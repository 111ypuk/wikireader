Quick start instructions
========================

This is only rough at the moment, need to expand it somewhat

make help gives a list of targets and some are explaind below

1) Set up a 32 bit Linux system
   or use schroot as described in doc/Using-schroot.text
   (this file also lists packages to install)

2) make sure samo-lib/include/config.h is setup
   copy from samo-lib/include/config.h-default

   The make files will do the copy, but the
   BOARD_SAMO_V1 must be uncommented by manual editing

3) if 32 bit then just make
   if 64 bit the run make in the 32 bit chroot as set up in (1)

4) to build the database
   (this should work in 32 or 64 bit as it mostly used Python2.6)

   make DESTDIR=image WORKDIR=work XML_FILES=xml-file-samples/japanese_architects.xml index parse render combine hash
   make DESTDIR=image install

5) format a microSD card as FAT32 and copy the contents on image to it
   e.g.   mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n wikird /dev/sd<id-and-partition>
          mount /dev/sd<id-and-partition> /mnt
          cp image/* /mnt/
