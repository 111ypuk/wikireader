A set of tools to work on a wikimedia dump/export

= Compile =
You will need at least Qt4.4 for the XML StreamReader implementation and

qmake-qt4; make

= Functionalities =
== Extract Titles ==
For testing indexing and finding articles we will need to extract every word
from the title and write it somewhere. This tool will help us to create such
an index

== Convert Articles to plain text ==
Convert wikipedia articles to plain text

== Give us the sha1 hash of an article ==
This will hash an article. This can be used for references to articles, e.g.
in an index or another article. Using a hash implies such a layout on disk

== Extract all words from Wikipedia ==
This can be used to generate a wordbook with frequencies from wikipedia
content and could be used as a source of predictive keyboards

= Considerations =
== Memory ==
There is always swap available but this does not mean that everything should be
kept in memory. So throw things away when they are not needed anymore.
