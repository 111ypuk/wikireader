      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation''' (AIM) is an organization which tests [[erotic actor]]s for [[HIV]] and other [[STD]]s on a scheduled basis.

Most tests for the sex industry actors are done at the Foundation's offices in [[San Fernando Valley]], [[Sherman Oaks, CA|Sherman Oaks]] and [[Granada Hills, CA|Granada Hills]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt4&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each month, about 1,200 actors are tested for HIV, with results as early as 14 days after infection. This test is effective ten days after potential infection, and anytime thereafter (HIV-1 DNA, by PCR) as compared to the alternative HIV test (HIV ELISA) which requires a six month waiting period to be effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;sxc3&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since the 1980s, an outbreak of [[AIDS]], aside from the general populace, has also caused a number of deaths of erotic actors.

The Director of the AIM Health Care Foundation, [[Sharon Mitchell|Dr. Sharon Mitchell]], a former erotic actor, left the industry in 1996 to qualify in public health counseling and [[sexology]] before setting up the Foundation in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?&amp;res=9C05EEDF123CF933A25756C0A9629C8B63
|title=Voice of Health in a Pornographic World
|accessdate=2007-02-26
|author=Nick Madigan
|date=2004-05-10
|publisher=New York Times
|quote=&lt;br /&gt;Sharon Mitchell &amp;mdash; ''Well-behaved women rarely make history''
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation has helped set up a system in the [[United States|U.S.]] where erotic actors in the [[adult film]] industry are tested for AIDS every 30 days. All on-camera sexual contact is logged, and a positive test result triggers the contacting and re-testing of all sexual partners during the previous three to six months.

==SxCheck==
Since 2006, AIM offers online services for selecting, scheduling, and paying for tests in affliation with local clinics and laboratories in many cities via the [http://www.sxcheck.com SxCheck] (alternatively [http://www.aim-med.org/ AIM Check]) website.&lt;ref name=&quot;sxc1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=Ask Dr Mitch
|author=Sharon Mitchell
|publisher=[http://www.sxcheck.com SxCheck]
|accessdate=2008-03-20
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, with secure online access to test results, faking of paper test results is prevented, since clients can select to privately share the results with others, as appropriate, either online or by email and mobile phone.&lt;ref name=&quot;sxc2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This system has resulted in low rates of [[HIV]] transmission, and hence low rates of infection among erotic actors: reportedly, not a single HIV test if an active adult industry performer had been positive in the four year period prior to 2004.

It was in 2004 that AIM assisted in the sex film industry shutdown, a quarantine that lasted less than 60 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt4&quot;/&gt; A male performer, [[Darren James]], tested positive for HIV in April and, to prevent another HIV outbreak, an urgent search was initiated for his potentially infected partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1&quot;/&gt; A total of four more performers,  [[Bianca Biaggi]], [[Jessica Dee]], [[Lara Roxx]], and [[Miss Arroyo]] were diagnosed with the virus by the end of the testing rounds, including one unrelated case in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E4DD143DF933A05757C0A9629C8B63|title= New H.I.V.

In 2009, the Los Angeles Public Health department and the Los Angeles Times claimed that there were 16 unreported of HIV among adults film actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;lat2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The '''AVN Awards''' are [[List of movie awards|movie awards]] sponsored and presented by the American [[adult video]] industry [[trade magazine]] ''[[AVN Magazine|AVN]]'' (''Adult Video News'') to honor exceptional performance in various aspects of the creation and marketing of American [[pornographic movie]]s. They are called the &quot;[[Academy Award|Oscars]] of porn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/the-oscars-of-porn/2006/01/09/1136655116166.html|title=The Oscars of porn|accessdate=July 25, 2007|date=January 9, 2006|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/ci_6039690?source=most_emailed|title=Porn: The Valley's secret industry|accessdate=July 25, 2007|author=Brent Hopkins|date=June 3, 2007|publisher=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|quote = ...earned seven Adult Video News awards, referred to as the Oscars of porn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=3400|title=Porn's Big Night|accessdate=July 25, 2007|author=David Schmader|date=March 9, 2000|publisher=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|quote=...the most prestigious event in the world of adult film: the Adult Video News Awards, hereby known as the AVNs, popularly known as the porno Oscars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AVN Awards comprise nearly 100 categories, some of which are analogous to industry awards offered in other film and video genres, and others that are specific to [[Pornography|pornographic]]/[[erotica|erotic]] [[film]] and [[video]].

AVN sponsored the first AVN Awards ceremony in February 1984.  The award ceremony occurs in early January during the [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo]], in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].  The 2008 AVN Awards were scheduled to air on [[Showtime]] on March 14, 2008 at 12am ET/PT &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sho.com/site/schedules/product_page.do?seriesid=0&amp;episodeid=131995 Showtime - Movies - AVN Adult Movie Awards - Main&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Awards for [[Gay pornography|gay adult video]] were a part of the AVN awards from the 1986 ceremony through the 1998 ceremony.  The increasing number of categories made the show unwieldy and for the 1999 ceremony ''AVN Magazine'' began hosting the [[GayVN Awards]], an annual adult movie award event for [[Gay pornography|gay adult video]].

Noted author and [[MacArthur Fellow]], [[David Foster Wallace]] covered the awards for ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' in 1998.

==Award categories==
In order to be eligible for a given year's AVN Awards, a title must have been released between October 1 of two years before and September 30 of one year before, and it must be available either from at least 10 [[wholesale]] or at least 100 [[retail]] outlets by the [[deadline]] of September 30 of the preceding year.

The Award's name is '''Woody.'''
There are many award categories, which are as follows:
&lt;small&gt;'''Note''':  &quot;Film&quot; and &quot;Video&quot; refer to the medium on which the title was produced; all of the titles are [[direct-to-video]] releases. &lt;/small&gt;

'''''Perversion for Profit''''' is a [[1965 in film|1965]] [[propaganda film]] financed by [[Charles Keating]] and narrated by news reporter [[George Putnam (newsman)|George Putnam]].  A vehement diatribe against [[pornography]], the film attempts to link explicit portrayals of [[human sexuality]] to the subversion of [[United States|American]] civilization, and briefly draws a parallel between pornography and the [[Communism|Communist]] conspiracy.  The film is in the [[public domain]], and it has become a popular download from the [[Prelinger Archives]].  ''Perversion for Profit'' illustrates its claims with still images taken from various [[soft core pornography]] magazines of the period, though with some portions of human anatomy [[censorship|obscured]] by colored rectangles.

To bolster his position, Putnam makes a reference to &quot;Dr. Sorokin, the renowned [[Harvard]] sociologist&quot;.  This individual is [[Pitirim Sorokin]], a Russian-American who founded Harvard's [[Sociology]] department and served as the [[American Sociological Association]]'s 55th president.

In an article discussing the Prelinger Archives for the ''San Francisco Chronicle,'' Peter L. Stein observes that the film has gained a different sort of utility than its producers intended:
:...as the parade of girlie magazine covers, men's [[physique]] pictorials and campy [[sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] leaflets continues, the film betrays a kind of prurience the filmmakers could hardly have intended. What results is a remarkable visual record of midcentury underground literature and sexual appetites, and a [[gloss]] on the values of the society that condemned them.
At the time the ''Chronicle'' article was written, ''Perversion'' was the Archive's second most popular download, superseded only by ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]].''  [[Sponsored film|Ephemeral film]] scholar [[Rick Prelinger]], founder of the Archive, views the popularity of such films as a sign the &quot;unofficial evidence of everyday life&quot; has become more interesting than &quot;'official' documents from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] or [[New York City|New York]]&quot;.

In 2004, a Prelinger Archive user going by the pseudonym &quot;Trafalgar&quot; produced a [[remix]], in which short clips from the film are rearranged to make a pro-pornography advocacy video.  Trafalgar's remix, entitled ''Come Join the Fun!'', is available from the [[Internet Archive]]'s open-source movie collection.  The [[electronica]] band [[3kStatic]] sampled audio from the original ''Perversion'' film for the title track of their [[2005 in music|2005]] album ''Perversion: for Profit.'' In 2008, the band [[Fight Like Apes]] sampled some audio for the track &quot;Snore Bore Whore&quot; from their album &quot;Fight Like Apes And The Mystery of the Golden Medallion&quot;, and Greek trance artist Yintan has set most of the narration to music [http://yintan.bandcamp.com].

==Quotations==
[[Image:Perversion-for-Profit-lesbian.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A typical image from the film: a photograph taken from a [[lesbian pornography]] magazine and [[censorship|censored]] with colored rectangles]]

* &quot;Now, you might ask yourself 'Why this sudden concern? Pornography and sex deviation have always been with mankind.' This is true. But, now, consider another fact: never in the history of the world have the merchants of obscenity, the teachers of unnatural sex acts, had available to them the modern facilities for disseminating this filth. High-speed presses, rapid transportation, mass distribution: all have combined to put the vilest obscenity within reach of every man, woman, and child in the country.&quot;—George Putnam, narrator.

* &quot;This same type of rot and decay caused sixteen of the nineteen major civilizations to vanish from the Earth. Magnificent [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]], all crumbled away not because of the strength of the aggressor, but because of moral decay from within. But we are in a unique position to cure our own ills: our [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was written by men who put their trust in God and founded a government based in His laws. These laws are on our side. We have a constitutional guarantee of protection against obscenity. And, in this day especially, we must seek to deliver ourselves from this twisting, torturing evil. We must save our nation from decay and deliver our children from the horrors of perversion. We must make our land, 'the land of the free', a safe home. O [[God]], deliver us, Americans, from evil.&quot;—George Putnam, narrator (closing words).

* &quot;This moral decay weakens our resistance to the onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.&quot;—George Putnam, narrator.

[[Image:frankhar.JPG|thumb|Frank Harris by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]].]]
'''Frank Harris''' (February 14, 1856 &amp;ndash; August 27, 1931) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[author]], [[Editing|editor]], [[journalist]] and [[publisher]] who was friendly with many well-known figures of his day. Though he attracted much attention during his life for his irascible, aggressive personality, editorship of famous periodicals, and friendship with the talented and famous, he is remembered mainly for his multiple-volume memoir ''My Life and Loves'', which was banned in countries around the world for its sexual explicitness.

==Life==
Frank Harris was born '''James Thomas Harris''' in [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], February 14, 1856 of Welsh parents{{Fact|date=April 2009}}. At the age of 12 he was sent to [[Wales]] to continue his education as a [[Boarding school|boarder]] at the [[Ruabon Grammar School]] in [[Denbighshire]], a time he was to remember later in ''My Life and Loves''.  Harris was unhappy at the school and ran away within a year.  While running away, Frank Harris discovered his true love.

Emigrating to the US in late 1869, he studied at the [[University of Kansas]]. In 1878 he married Florence Ruth Adams, who died the following year. Returning to England in 1882, Harris first came to general notice as the editor of a series of [[London]] papers including the ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'', the ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'' and the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'', the last-named being the high point of his journalistic career, with [[H. G. Wells]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] as regular contributors. 

Harris returned to [[New York]] during [[World War I]]. From 1916 to 1922 he edited the U.S. edition of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]''. ''Pearson's'' has been described as &quot;Probably second in fame to ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', which it imitated ... a heavily romantic publication&quot;{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Harris became an American citizen in April, 1921. In 1922 he traveled to Berlin to publish his best-known work, his autobiography ''My Life and Loves'' (published in four volumes, 1922-1927). It is notorious for its graphic descriptions of Harris's purported [[sexual encounter]]s and for its exaggeration of the scope of his adventures and his role in history. A fifth volume, supposedly taken from his notes but of doubtful provenance, was published in 1954, long after his death.

A 1923 attempt to sell the book in [[Paris]] caused it to be seized by French authorities.

The British occultist, mystic, and sexual revolutionary [[Aleister Crowley]] lived with him in 1924; according to one source{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, they both shared similar &quot;money troubles&quot; and were &quot;equal hypochondriacs&quot;.

Harris also wrote short stories and novels, two books on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], a series of biographical sketches in five volumes under the title ''Contemporary Portraits'' and biographies of his friends [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. His attempts at playwriting were less successful: only ''Mr. and Mrs. Daventry'' (1900) (which was based on an idea by [[Oscar Wilde]]) was produced on the stage.

The Frank Harris Publishing Company was founded in [[New York]] in the mid-to-late 1920s to promote and distribute his works in America. [[Esar Levine]], whose Harris collection is housed at [[Princeton University]], was one of his employees and disciples. Married three times, Harris died in [[France]] on August 27 1931, of a heart attack.

Harris appeared as a character in the play [[Oscar Wilde (play)|Oscar Wilde]], written by Leslie &amp; [[Sewell Stokes]],  at the Fulton Theatre, New York, 1938, starring [[Robert Morley]].

*''Oscar Wilde, His Life and Confessions'' (1916). 
*''My Life and Loves'', complete (1922). 
*''The Short Stories of Frank Harris, a Selection'' (1975). Edited by [[Elmer Gertz]]; a representative collection

== Portrayal on Film and Television ==

''[[Cowboy (1958 film)|Cowboy]]'' (1958) is an adaptation of the semi-autobiographical novel ''My Reminiscences as a Cowboy''. Harris is played by [[Jack Lemmon]]. 

He is seen as a minor character in ''The Trials of Oscar Wilde'' (1960) played by Paul Rogers.

On television, Harris was played by [[Leonard Rossiter]] in a 1978 BBC Play of the Week: ''Fearless Frank, or, Tidbits From The Life Of An Adventurer''. 

Harris was also featured in an episode of ''The Edwardians'' (1972) played by John Bennett.

He is a character in the 1997 [[Tom Stoppard]] play &quot;[[The Invention of Love]]&quot;, which deals with the life of [[A. E. Housman]] and the Oscar Wilde trials.

He appears in the first episode of the [[2001]] miniseries ''[[The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells]]'', rejecting a story from Wells for being too long and too preposterous.

Harris appears as a [[vampire]] in [[Kim Newman]]'s 1992 novel ''[[Anno Dracula (novel)|Anno Dracula]]'', as the mentor and vampire sire of one of the novel's main characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''Secret Museum''' or '''Secret Cabinet''' ('''Gabinetto Segreto''') principally refers to the collection of [[erotic]] or sexually explicit finds from [[Pompeii]], held in separate galleries in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]], [[Naples]], [[Italy]], the former Museo Borbonico. The [[British Museum]] also contained [[Secretum (British Museum)|secret rooms]]. 

Throughout ancient [[Pompeii]], [[erotic]] [[fresco]]es, depictions of the god [[Priapus]], sexually explicit [[symbols]], [[inscriptions]], and even household items (such as phallic oil lamps) were found. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] culture had a different sense of shame for sexuality, and viewed sexually explicit material very differently to most present-day cultures.&lt;ref&gt;For Roman views of sexuality, see Paul Veyne, &quot;Pleasures and ecxcesses&quot; in ''A History of Private Life: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium'', Philippe Ariès and Georges Duby, eds. (Harvard University Press) 1987:183-207.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideas about [[obscene|obscenity]] developed from the 18th century to the present day into a modern concept of [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[History of erotic depictions]]&lt;!--this note responds to a request for a citation--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although the excavation of Pompeii was initially an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project, once artifacts were classified through a new method of [[taxonomy]], those deemed obscene and unsuitable for the general public were termed [[pornography]] and in 1819 they were locked away in a Secret Museum. These even included the un-explicit statue ''[[Venus Kallipygos]]'', only erotic to 18th and 19th century eyes due to her partial nudity and the exposure of her [[eponymous]] &quot;beautiful buttocks&quot;.  For good measure, the doorway was bricked up in 1849 (Garcia y Garcia et al. 2001). At Pompeii, locked metal cabinets were constructed over erotic frescos, which could be shown, for a modest additional fee, to gentlemen but not to ladies. This [[peep show]] was still in operation at Pompeii in the 1960s (Hare 2003). The cabinet was only accessible to &quot;people of mature age and respected morals&quot;, which in practice meant only educated males. The catalogue of the secret museum was also a form of censorship, where engravings and descriptive texts played down the content of the room.

The excavation of [[Pompeii]] was important to a range of powerful, and often conflicting, interests who saw the discovery of Pompeii as validating their own view of history, but at the same time excluded anything that did not fit the preferred model. Later [[Mussolini]]  saw the excavation of Pompeii as validating the continuity of a [[New Rome|Nova Roma]]. The presence of sexually explicit material, however, was problematic.

Re-opened, closed, re-opened again and then closed again for nearly a hundred years, the secret room was briefly made accessible again at the end of the 1960s before being finally re-opened in the year 2000. Since 2005, the collection is kept in a separate room in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].

'''Adult video arcades''' are X-rated movie previewing areas.  They are 
almost always attached to a [[sex shop]] or an adult book store (ABS), where magazines, 
movies, and sexual aids are sold.  An arcade consists of typically a dozen 
or more private (or sometimes semi-private) viewing booths, containing a 
video monitor, a panel of controls, and a seat.  Sometimes these booths are 
arranged in a maze-like fashion.  Often the lighting will be dim, perhaps only red or green lights near each booth, indicating their availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Military Trade|publisher=[[Haworth Press]]|author=Zeeland, Steven|year=1999|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gzbhot9sdEoC|isbn=078900402X|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transactions==

Movie time is purchased either by coin or cash activation within the booth, 
or by purchasing tokens or a block of time in advance.&lt;ref name=Simpson/&gt; Generally a 
selection of 15 to 50 movies is available for browsing.  These movies are 
straight, gay, bisexual, and sometimes transsexual.  Some more modern 
systems display more than one screen at a time for easier selection.

==Fixtures==

In most ABS, the arcades will have &quot;buddy booths.&quot;  These booths are 
adjacent, and allow for interplay between occupants.  Some of them have 
windows so &quot;buddies&quot; may watch each other masturbate.  Between other booths 
there may be [[Glory hole (sexual)|glory holes]] for [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name=Simpson&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex terror: erotic misadventures in pop culture|publisher=[[Haworth Press]]|author=Simpson, Mark|year=2002|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=faJjmFkSaEcC|isbn=1560233761|pages=58,103,142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Black Book, mosh pit&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The '''Athletic Model Guild''', or '''AMG''', was founded by [[gay pornography]] pioneer [[Bob Mizer]] in December 1945. During those post-war years, United States censorship laws allowed women, but not men, to appear in various states of undress in what were referred to, with a wink, as “art” photographs. Mizer began his business by taking pictures of men that he knew, both gay and [[straight]]. His subjects would often pose for pictures, which, while ostensibly meant to illustrate fitness tips and the like, were clearly produced and published as homoerotic material.

__TOC__
{{clear}}
==History==
A majority of the early AMG films and photos were ambiguously sexual in nature. The formula consisted of images (moving and still) of young men doing bodybuilding poses, or perhaps wrestling in pairs. Often the setup or “plot” of these shoots was fairly absurd and just served to provide a rather “thin” legal pretext for the display of the male physique. 

Mizer did appear in court to face several charges over the years, including obscenity, drug use, and prostitution.  Allegedly, Mizer's AMG models would sometimes make a little extra money “renting” themselves out, but Mizer argued vigorously that it was not his business what they did on their own time. Despite some legal setbacks, AMG survived its many trials. 

The AMG material (sold in the form of photographic prints, a magazine and short films) slowly evolved over time - from altered images where the male genitalia were “painted” over to photographic prints where the models wore extremely skimpy posing straps and then finally (as the changing laws allowed) to full nudity. 

Several bodybuilders and actors of the day got their start posing for Mizer and his friends at AMG. It is estimated that he shot over 10,000 men throughout the course of his career. [[Andy Warhol]]'s protégé [[Joe Dallesandro]], who later worked for [[Calvin Klein]], was one of the many AMG models that even those not acquainted with The Athletic Model Guild might be familiar with. Others included [[Ed Fury]] and [[Glenn Corbett]] of ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]''. Bodybuilder action movie star, and now Governor of [[California]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] posed for AMG under Mizer in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;athleticmodelguild.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.athleticmodelguild.com/timeline.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 movie ''[[Beefcake]]'' directed by Thom Fitzgerald, combines documentary footage with fictional dramatizations in an attempt to tell the story of Mizer and AMG.

After Bob Mizer’s death in May 1992, Wayne Stanley, a friend and legal advisor, tended to his archives. In 2004 the company and its archives were sold to physique photographer Dennis Bell.

Under Dennis Bell's reins, Athletic Model Guild is once again thriving and 2008 will mark its 63rd anniversary.  The legacy material from Bob Mizer's archives that was once feared lost to time is being organized and digitally remastered.  This new material is branded under AMG FILM CLASSICS.  New DVD releases contain full length films, as well as never-before-seen film clips and behind the scenes footage as extras.  Along with its primary mission of preserving the history and legacy of Bob Mizer and AMG, the company continues to produce new original movies that keep the AMG spirit alive in the present. In his own style, Bell launched the highly acclaimed brand AMG Brasil, a new line of erotic films shot on location in Brazil, that feature the same youthful models and &quot;joyful spirit&quot; of life that Mizer once loved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Free Speech Coalition''' or, FSC, is a [[Industry trade group|trade association]] of the [[pornography]] and [[Sex industry|adult entertainment]] industry in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1991, it opposes the passage and enforcement of some [[censorship]] laws (with the exception of 'anti-piracy' laws) and [[obscenity]] laws. 

The organization was founded by a group of concerned industry professionals in response to numerous government attacks against producers and retailers of adult products. Its roots are embedded deep within the birth and development of adult entertainment in the United States, and the organization has continued to grow with the industry’s own explosive growth, now representing all segments of adult entertainment on a national level.

The Free Speech Coalition is the successor of the [[Adult Film Association of America]].

The organization initiated ''[[Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition]]'', which in 2002 the [[United States Supreme Court|US Supreme Court]] decided in the Coalition's favor, overturning as unconstitutional parts of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996.

Issues in which the Free Speech Coalition is currently involved include:
* challenging [[Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act|2257]] regulations in court (''Free Speech Coalition v. Gonzales'')
* opposing the proposed [[.xxx]] [[top-level domain]]
* rebutting claims of [[pornography addiction]] and harmful &quot;secondary effects&quot; of pornography
* Workplace Safety
* Anti-Piracy

The group performs lobbying in the state of [[California]] and on a federal level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Golden Age of Porn''' or '''porno chic''' refers to a brief modern period in the [[History of erotic depictions|history of pornography]], approximately from the late-sixties to the early-to-mid-1980s. &lt;ref name=Glass&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4053/is_200210/ai_n9085969 Second wave: Feminism and porn's golden age]. ''Radical Society'' Oct 2002 by Loren Glass&lt;/ref&gt; The period is idealized as a time in history where difficult to treat or untreatable [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]] had not achieved wide public notice and [[birth control]] and [[abortion]] permitted [[sexual intercourse|sex]] for pleasure without worries about unwanted pregnancies. This freedom was ostensibly reflected in the [[pornography]] industry, with adult movies and magazines approaching the mainstream and becoming increasingly visible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/urge/feature/1999/02/04feature.html Boogie bites: Porn star activists want to pave the way for a new era of enlightened porn...but isn't this an oxymoron?]. [[Salon.com]], By Jenn Shreve&lt;/ref&gt; 

The golden age was also typified by interactions with the contemporaneous [[second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]].  These were [[radical feminists|radical]] and [[cultural feminism|cultural feminists]] allied with the [[Christian right|religious right]] in attacking pornography, while other feminists were more concerned with ideas of sexual liberation and freedom from government intrusion into the growing industry.&lt;ref name=Glass /&gt;

The origins of the Golden Age are typically associated with the massive success of the movies ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''  and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'', which were both released in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Porn studies|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|author=Williams, Linda |year=2004|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rdWZ8JD5dkkC|isbn=0822333120|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two were the first hardcore porn films to reach a mass mixed-sex audience,&lt;ref name=Hardcore&gt;{{cite book|title=Hard core: power, pleasure, and the &quot;frenzy of the visible&quot;|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|author=[[Linda Williams|Williams, Linda]] |year=1999|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3wAe48_yfNUC|isbn=0520219430|page=156-158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both received positive reviews in mainstream media.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of organized crime in the United States|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|author=Robert J. Kelly, Ko-lin Chin, Rufus Schatzberg |year=1994|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CWg1Efv5C5UC|isbn=0313283664|page=301-302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other key films from the period include ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'', ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'', and ''[[Score (film)|Score]]'', which appeared in [[mainstream]] moviehouses of the [[United States]] for the first time.
 
These movies saw the blossoming of pornography in the mainstream consciousness, whereby drive-in theatres would take out full page newspaper ads to promote the latest adult features. Porn films started being shown in mainstream public theaters, and thus were accepted as suitable for public consumption, or at least tolerated.&lt;ref name=Glass/&gt; ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' (1978) is also regarded as one of the most important releases during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The encyclopedia of guilty pleasures: 1001 things you hate to love|publisher=[[Quirk Books]]|author=Sam Stall, Lou Harry, Julia Spalding |year=2004|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LqaOE25UiMsC|isbn=1931686548|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mainstream attention==
For a period of two or three years it was fashionable to watch and discuss such films. An influential five-page article about the movie ''Deep Throat'' in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' in early 1973 used the phrase &quot;porno chic&quot; in the title and described the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Blumenthal: Porno chic; &quot;Hard-core&quot; grows fashionable-and very profitable, ''The New York Times Magazine'', 21 January 1973&lt;/ref&gt;
Actress [[Linda Lovelace]] once stated at that time that she believed that the porn industry would merge with the [[Mainstream#In Film|mainstream film industry]].&lt;ref&gt;From an 1970s interview in the documentary ''[[Inside Deep Throat]]''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porno chic actors==
During the Golden Age of Porn, adult film stars such as [[Linda Lovelace]], [[Marilyn Chambers]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Lisa DeLeeuw]],  [[Harry Reems]], [[John Leslie]], [[Ron Jeremy]] and [[John C. Holmes]], a.k.a. &quot;[[Johnny Wadd]],&quot; became household names and much sought-out superstars. 

As their popularity rose, so did their control of their careers. [[John Holmes]] became the first recurring porn character in the wildly popular &quot;Johnny Wadd&quot; film series. [[Lisa DeLeeuw]] was one of the first to sign an exclusive contract with with a major adult production company [[Vivid Video]] and [[Marilyn Chambers]] worked in mainstream movies being one of the few cross over porn actors. 

The dominant pornographic [[film studio]]s of the age were [[VCA Pictures]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.avn.com/articles/9322.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Caballero Home Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skinflicks: The Inside Story of the X-Rated Video Industry|publisher=[[AuthorHouse]]|author=Jennings, David |year=2000
|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3VCVm7sc5JsC|isbn=158721184X|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
More recently, &quot;porno chic&quot; or &quot;porn chic&quot; has been used to refer to the mainstreaming of [[pornography]] and the use of [[imagery]] from pornography in [[popular culture]], such as [[advertising]], [[music video]]s, movies and [[cable television]].&lt;ref&gt;William L. Hamilton: The Mainstream Flirts With Pornography Chic. ''The New York Times'', 21 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Adult models and actresses are routinely interviewed on [[radio]] and appear on &quot;The [[Howard Stern]] Show.&quot; As a result, such actresses, as well as a few actors such as [[Ron Jeremy]], have received increased exposure. In the 1990s it became common for mainstream [[Hollywood]] actors to date [[pornographic actor|adult video star]]s.{{Fact|date=November 2008}} In some cases, private videos subsequently made by them were discovered and later sold over the [[Internet]].

Perhaps inspired by the aesthetic of the original &quot;porno chic&quot; films, Pornochic (as one word) is also the title of a European pornographic film series first introduced in the early 2000's and produced by [[Marc Dorcel]].

The latter use of the term has been promoted by British media researcher [[Brian McNair]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikk.uio.no/arrangementer/konferens/tallin03/Sorensen.pdf The mainstreaming of pornography in mass culture], by Anette Dina Sørensen. Talk given in 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Age was commemorated in the 1997 mainstream film ''[[Boogie Nights]]''.

==Fashion and criticism==
[[Barneys]] creative director [[Simon Doonan]] has criticized porno chic fashion style in his book, ''Eccentric Glamour: Creating an Insanely More Fabulous You.''&lt;ref&gt;Colin Bertram, ''[[New York Daily News]],'' March 31, 2008 &quot;Simon Doonan of Barneys wants to take us off our diet of raunch dressing,&quot; http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2008/03/31/2008-03-31_simon_doonan_of_barneys_wants_to_take_us-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Michele Malkin]] has criticized [[Beyonce]] (owner of the [[House of Deréon]] clothing line) and other leaders of clothing lines, for marketing flirtatious clothes to elementary school children.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Malkin, &quot;Kiddie-Porn: Beyonce's Tiny Ho's&quot; &quot;New York Post&quot; May 14, 2008 http://www.nypost.com/seven/05142008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/kiddie_porn_chic__beyonces_tiny_hos_110817.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Dutch academicians Linda Duits and Liesbet van Zoonen have argued that public debates about teenage girls' adoption of porno chic (in the manner of [[bellyshirt]]s and exposed [[G-strings]]) constitute a &quot;[[metonymic]] location&quot; of a social dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Duits and Liesbet van Zoonen, &quot;Headscarves and Porno-Chic: Disciplining Girls’ Bodies in the European Multicultural Society&quot; &quot;European Journal of Women’s Studies&quot; 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fans of X-Rated Entertainment''' ('''F.O.X.E.''', also known as '''FOXE''') is a [[United States]] based [[pornography]] [[Fan (person)|fan]] organization founded by legendary [[adult film]] actor, director, and critic [[William Margold]], and actress [[Viper (porn star)|Viper]].&lt;ref name=FoxeMargold&gt;[http://www.foxe.com/william-margold.html William Margold - Founder of FOXE] from official site&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates against [[censorship]] of pornography, and gives annual adult film awards.

== Awards ==
The annual FOXE awards ceremony presents three standard awards, decided by fan vote: Male Fan Favorite, Female Fan Favorite, and Video Vixen for a new female performer. Additional special awards are presented some years. In the 1990s, the Fan Favorite awards were often shared, but Vixen was always for one recipient. Since the 11th FOXE awards, the ceremony has included a &quot;Broast&quot; (a &quot;benign [[roast (comedy)|roast]]&quot;&lt;ref name=AVN2005/&gt;) of a well known performer who also receives a lifetime achievement award. Any performer winning Fan Favorite three times is &quot;retired&quot; with the FOXE X award, and ineligible for further awards.&lt;ref name=AVN2006/&gt; Holders of the FOXE X include [[Tera Patrick]], [[Nina Hartley]], [[Ashlyn Gere]] and [[Jill Kelly]].&lt;ref name=TeraFOXEX&gt;[http://ainews.com/Archives/Story10100.phtml &quot;Tera Wins FOXE X&quot;] [[February 21]], [[2006]] , ''Adult Industry News''.

The '''San Francisco Armory''', also known as the '''San Francisco National Guard Armory and Arsenal''' or simply '''The Armory''', is a historic building in the [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]] of [[San Francisco, California]].

==National Guard Armory==
The building was constructed as an [[armory (military)|armory]] and [[arsenal]] for the [[United States National Guard]] in 1912–1914 and designed with a [[castle]]-like appearance in a [[Moorish Revival]] style.&lt;ref name=baycitynews&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/baycitynews/archive/2007/01/09/kink09.DTL &quot;Kink.com buys SF Armory&quot;], ''[[Bay City News]]'', January 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mdispatch&gt;[http://www.missiondispatch.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=4a744311a7b1d85a7e00059fc03b1125 &quot;Then: Old Armory; Now: Porn Studio] by Jonathan Farrell, ''Mission Dispatch'', February 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was built as a replacement for the old San Francisco Armory in the [[Western Addition, San Francisco, California|Western Addition]], which had been destroyed by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]].&lt;ref name=lloyd&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2000/10/03/lloyd.DTL &quot;Cursed Armory Has Hexed Developers for Over Twenty Years&quot;] by Carol Lloyd, ''[[SFGate.com]]'', October 3, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its role as an armory and arsenal, during the 1920s, it served as a venue for sporting events, such as [[prizefights]].&lt;ref name=office&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/2000/02/24/NEWS13512.dtl &quot;S.F.

After 1976, the building was largely unused for the next 30 years, though in 1978 the building was registered as a Class 2 historical landmark in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Several spaceship-interior scenes in the movie ''[[Star Wars]]'' were filmed there, and the [[San Francisco Opera]] used the large inner court of The Armory for [[set construction]] and rehearsals until the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=storage&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/07/24/NEWS5223.dtl &quot;Armory sold for $1.25 million&quot;] by Gerald D.

Many of these proposals were marked by acrimonious debates between various community interests. Concerns over [[gentrification]], social and environmental impact or the unsuitability of the structure for various uses resulted in none of the various plans for the structure reaching fruition.&lt;ref name=sfarmory.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=switch/&gt;&lt;ref name=condo/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/us/12armory.html?ex=1328936400&amp;en=7944c8a737e28e92&amp;ei=5088 &quot;A Neighbor Moves in With Ropes and Shackles, and Some Are Not So Pleased&quot;] by Jesse Mckinley, ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The building eventually came to be described, variously, as &quot;a herd of [[white elephant]]s&quot;,&lt;ref name=adams/&gt; &quot;cursed&quot;,&lt;ref name=lloyd/&gt; and &quot;not a friendly building&quot;.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Kink.com purchase==
[[Image:Leather pride flag SF.jpg|thumb|left|The [[leather pride flag]] waving on the Armory building in 2008.]]
In late 2006, The Armory was purchased for [[United States dollar|$]]14.5 million by [[Kink.com]], a San Francisco-based [[internet pornography]] producer specializing in [[BDSM]] pornography.&lt;ref name=ex-armory&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/13/BAG0INI8PD1.DTL &quot;Ex-armory turns into porn site&quot;] by Steve Rubenstein, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', January 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooallem&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/magazine/29kink.t.html &quot;A Disciplined Business&quot;] by Jon Mooallem, ''The New York Times,'' April 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, the company is using the building as a studio for production of content for their websites.&lt;ref name=protest&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/02/09/BAG7LO1HPN1.DTL &quot;Porn studio says armory filming has begun&quot;] by Steve Rubenstein, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Acworth]], the company's owner, has stated that the structure suits the needs of the company very well without need for significant structural modifications to the building, and that the company would begin repairs to the decaying structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooallem&quot; /&gt; It was also announced that Kink.com planned at some point in the future to rent out studio space for [[film]] production of all kinds within The Armory.&lt;ref name=sfarmory.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ex-armory/&gt;&lt;ref name=bar&gt;[http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=1648 &quot;Planning Commission hears Kink.com case&quot;] by Liz Highleyman, ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale was not announced until January 2007 as a result of a [[non-disclosure agreement]] with the previous owner.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt; The sale drew a mixed response from the San Francisco community. Many people welcomed this use of The Armory as a way of revitalizing the structure and bringing back business to the area without altering the appearance of the historic building, as well as being in keeping with San Francisco's tradition of accommodating [[sexual minorities]].&lt;ref name=sfgtv&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=20&amp;clip_id=3256 &quot;San Francisco Planning Commission - Special Public Hearing&quot;], ''SFGTV'', March 8, 2007. (link to streaming [[Windows Media]] video and downloadable [[MP3]] audio)&lt;/ref&gt; Others were disturbed that a pornography studio would be located in the middle of a residential neighborhood near schools, or were opposed to the abandonment of plans for low-income housing at the site, as well as the lack of community input into this use of The Armory.&lt;ref name=sfgtv/&gt;&lt;ref name=lagos&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/26/BAG5RNPKIV1.DTL  No welcome mat for adult film studio&quot;] by Marisa Lagos, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', January 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=3027&amp;catid=4 &quot;Kink hearing: The pornographer's purchase of the Armory faces more roadblocks&quot;] by Deborah Giattina, ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'', March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group known as the Mission Armory Community Collective soon formed in opposition to Kink.com's use of The Armory; the group held a public protest in front of The Armory in early February 2007.&lt;ref name=protest/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooallem&quot; /&gt; San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] also expressed concern over the Kink.com purchase, and scheduled a special meeting of the San Francisco Planning Commission in March 2007 to review the company's use of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooallem&quot; /&gt; This public meeting was well-attended by both supporters and detractors of the Kink.com purchase. The Planning Commission for its part ruled that Kink.com was not in violation of any law or [[zoning]] requirement.&lt;ref name=bar/&gt;&lt;ref name=lagos/&gt;

Although Kink.com has stated that its activities would be invisible to the surrounding neighborhood, La Casa de las Madres, a neighboring [[women's shelter]], announced in late March 2007 that they would be leaving the location. The shelter had planned on moving from that location in 2009 when their lease expired, but stated that they would be leaving early because of Kink.com's presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://masshightech.bizjournals.com/masshightech/othercities/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/03/26/story12.html?b=1174881600%5E1436304 &quot;Service organization flees from kinky Mission neighbor&quot;] by Sarah Duxbury, ''San Francisco Business Times'', March 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, Acworth approached the San Francisco Planning Commission with the idea of converting part of the Armory space into [[webcam]]-lined [[condominiums]]. However, Acworth also described the plans as &quot;extremely hypothetical&quot; and stated that, &quot;There is no firm plan for using the Armory for anything but a conventional film studio for now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/16/BAO0TV290.DTL &quot;Porn prince wants to build kinky condos in Armory&quot;] by Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', December 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc11.com/news/14872145/detail.html &quot;SF Armory Could Become 'Kinky Condos'&quot;], ''[[NBC11]]'', December 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May and December, 2008, the San Francisco Armory hosted Mission Bazaar, an all-ages arts fair featuring local artists and craftspeople selling their work, as well as performances. It was the first public event held in the Armory since the 1970s. &lt;ref&gt;[http://laughingsquid.com/mission-bazaar-a-unique-craft-performance-expo-at-the-armory/ &quot;Mission Bazaar, a Unique Craft &amp; Performance Expo at The Armory&quot;] ''Laughing Squid'', May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imagery of nude celebrities''' is in widespread demand and is a lucrative business. Depictions of [[celebrity|celebrities]] have been exploited by vendors of [[pornography]] and others in many different forms of media. Genres include [[celebrity sex tape]]s, [[paparazzi]] photos capturing unintentional or private scenes, [[film screenshots]], faked or doctored images, and shots from magazines. 

==Background==
The commercial demand for images of nude celebrities has been known for many decades. ''[[Playboy]]'' [[magazine]] is renowned for offering famous women large amounts of money to appear nude in its magazine, and more downmarket pornographic magazines search far and wide for nude pictures of celebrities taken unaware &amp;mdash; for example, when they are bathing topless or nude at what the subject thought was a secluded beach, or taken before the individual was well-known. These [[paparazzi]] photos are in high demand among sensational magazines and press.

In many nation, [[privacy law]] and [[personality rights]] can lead to civil action against organizations that publish photos of nude celebrities without a [[model release]], and this restricts the availability of such photos through the print media. On the Internet, the difficulty of identifying offenders and applying court sanction makes circulation of such photographs much less risky.  Such photographs circulate through many online photo distribution channels such as [[Usenet]] and [[Internet forum]]s, and commercial operators, often in countries beyond the reach of courts, also offer such photos for commercial gain. [[Copyright]] restrictions are often ignored.

In some cases, when the depicted person is young and the photo is an actual photo, nude media of celebrities may fall under the purvue of [[child pornography]] laws, a legal regime with harsh penalties for distribution. When the photos are faked or doctored, the media is classified as [[simulated pornography]].

==Types of nude celebrity media ==

Media of nude celebrities fall into five main categories:

* '''Film screenshots:''' Many actors and actresses have done nude or partially nude scenes in non-pornographic mainstream films. [[Screenshot]]s from these films are circulated widely and can usually be recognized by the low picture quality (from video). However, increased popularity of [[broadband]] internet access makes possible the distribution of actual video clips and higher quality images, these usually copied from DVDs. Often screenshots of these scenes are displayed in several frames as tiles. 

* '''Paparazzi photographs:''' Occasionally, celebrities are photographed in revealing real-life situations; the most common scenario is a woman sunbathing [[toplessness|topless]], usually on a [[beach]],  [[yacht]] or by a pool. The photos are usually taken from a distance and rarely reveal more than breasts, although some celebrities have been photographed fully nude. Other types of paparazzi images of nude celebrities include '[[Wardrobe malfunction|nipple slips]]', in which low cut dresses, lack of a bra, an accidental fall of clothing or camera flash glares may reveal a celebrity's nipples.&lt;p&gt;A final form is the increasingly frequent occurrence of an &quot;[[upskirt]]&quot; shot of female. Most such images show underwear, but some situations (such as celebrities exiting cars) have resulted in snapshots which are claimed to show genitalia.    

* '''Nude photo shoots:''' Mainstream sex magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'' or photographic art magazines such as ''[[Black+White|Black and White]]'' routinely feature nude shoots of celebrities. Some celebrities have modeled for nude photographs prior to becoming famous. Such images are often later redistributed in digital form by the publisher, or by a third party. 

* '''Stolen private materials:''' Rarely, private sexual photographs or [[celebrity sex tape|videos]] are stolen or obtained from a former lover/spouse and show up on the Internet. See [[celebrity sex tape]].

* '''Fake or doctored photos:''' Many images found on the Internet and in the [[yellow press]] are fake images, primarily made with various [[digital image manipulation]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/fakers.html Wired: These Are Definitely Not Scully's Breasts], Accessed 2009-05-19&lt;/ref&gt; These typically combine the most recognizable features of a celebrity, such as their face, with the nude body of a suitable lesser-known pornography actor. Unlike other forms of nude media of celebrities, faked photos can be produced with little effort or resources and do not require access to the celebrity, making them a popular option for amateurs.

==Famous cases==

*On October 19, 1998, a website called [[Seth Warshavsky|ClubLove]] posted nude photos of [[Laura Schlessinger]] (&quot;Dr. Laura&quot;), which were taken in the 1970s by her then-boyfriend. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/information-services-online/6411424-1.html A Nude Dr. Laura to Star Again on clublove.com; Seth Warshavsky Revives Sexy 'Dirty Dozen' Photos...], allbusiness.com&lt;/ref&gt;
*Prior to becoming famous, [[Heather Mills]] worked as a [[glamour model]] and was photographed nude in a book entitled ''Die Freuden der Liebe''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article50770.ece Lady Macca's porno past], ''The Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puzzy Power''' (aka '''HotMale''') is a Danish film company started in 1997 as a subsidiary to [[Lars von Trier]]'s company [[Zentropa (film company)|Zentropa]], with the goal of producing [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[pornographic film]]s for women. It is the only time ever a mainstream film company has openly produced hardcore porno films&lt;ref&gt;AVN Europe, November 2007, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The initiative was taken by producer [[Lene Børglum]], who as leader of Puzzy Power gathered a group of women (sexologist [[Gerd Winther]], editor [[Lili Henriksen]], porn model and journalist [[Christina Lohse]], line-producer [[Vibeke Windeløv]] and production assistant [[Mette Nelund]]) and developed a so-called &quot;Statement on women and sensuality&quot;, later called The Puzzy Power Manifesto. The manifesto was shaped as a guide for the production of erotic films for women.

== Filmography ==
=== ''Constance'' ===
The first film produced by Puzzy Power was ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998), directed by [[Knud Vesterskov]] with [[Katja K]]ean, [[Anaïs]] and [[Mark Duran]] in the leading roles. It tells the story of a young woman, Constance, who arrives at the experienced Lola's house, where she is initiated into the mysteries of sexuality. The story is told in flashback via a framing devise with lyrical diary excerpts and naration read by mainstream actresses [[Christiane Bjørg Nielsen]] and [[Hella Joof]].

=== ''Pink Prison'' ===
The second film was ''Pink Prison'' (1999), directed by [[Lisbeth Lynghøft]] with [[Katja K]]ean and [[Mr. Marcus]] in the leads. It's about the photo journalist Mila, who infiltrates a men's penitentiary in hope of obtaining an exclusive interview with the prison warden. The film, which culminates in a lesbian scene with religious subtext, was filmed in the prison set from [[Lars von Trier]]s film ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'' (2000).

Both ''Constance'' and ''Pink Prison'' received international attention and became the best selling sex videos in Scandinavia. In 2001, ''Constance'' was nominated for three [[AVN Award]]s for Best Art Direction, Best Music and Best Videography. In 2003, ''Pink Prison'' won a [[Venus Award]] as Best Scandinavian Film. On March 12 2006 pornography was legalized in Norway, following a case which involved a positive qualitative appraisal of ''Constance'' and ''Pink Prison''.[http://medietilsynet.no/om/nyhetsarkiv/filmklagenemnda0906]

=== ''HotMen CoolBoyz'' ===
The third film was the gay feature ''HotMen CoolBoyz'' (2000), directed by [[Knud Vesterskov]] and starring [[Ron Athey]] and [[Billy Herrington]]. In this connection, the Puzzy Power company called itself HotMale. The film was no financial success, but was nominated for five [[GayVN Award]]s, including Best Foreign Film.

== Restructuring ==
At the start of 2001, Zentropa's CEO [[Peter Aalbæk Jensen]] announced his intention to close Puzzy Power, which he claimed had been a financial disappointment. Both ''Constance'' and ''Pink Prison'' were however still ranking high on international sales lists, and soon after ''HotMen CoolBoyz'' was released as an international deluxe DVD-edition. Puzzy Power was not closed, but continued administrating the distribution and income of its three feature productions.

The task of producing new sex films for Zentropa went to a new subsidiary (later independent) company, [[Innocent Pictures]]. The two first productions from [[Innocent Pictures]] were the educational DVD ''[[Femi-X and Beyond]]'' (2004), directed by [[Nicolas Barbano]] with [[Joan Ørting]] as host, and the feature film ''[[All About Anna]]'' (2005), directed by [[Jessica Nilsson]] and starring [[Gry Bay]] and [[Mark Stevens]]. In spite of a difficult production, ''All About Anna'' became an even bigger success than both ''Constance'' and ''Pink Prison''.

The full story of Puzzy Power and [[Innocent Pictures]] is told in [[Thomas Vilhelm]]'s book ''Filmbyen'' (Ekstra Bladets Forlag, 2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''Stalags redirects here. For the POW camps, see [[Stalag]]. For the documentary about Stalag fiction, see [[Stalags (film)]]''
[[Image:Ma 416Stalag.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The front and back cover of ''Stalag 13'', an example of Stalag literature, shows the sexualization of female SS guards characteristic of the genre.]]
'''Stalag fiction''' was a short-lived genre of [[Israeli literature|Israeli fiction]] [[Nazi exploitation]] that flourished in the early 1960s, at the time of the [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann trial]].

==Premise==
Purported to be translations of English-language books by prisoners in [[concentration camp]]s, these books were highly [[pornography|pornographic]] accounts of imprisonment, generally of Allied soldiers, sexual [[Sado-masochism|brutalization]] by female [[SS]] guards, and the prisoners' eventual revenge, which usually consisted of the [[rape]] and [[murder]] of their tormentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2007/09/06/documentary_looks_at_nazi_porn_in_israel/5000/| title=Documentary looks at Nazi porn in Israel| work=[[UPI]] | date=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books, with titles like ''I Was Colonel Schultz's Private Bitch'', were especially popular among adolescent boys, often the children of concentration camp survivors.

==History==
The books emerged from the culture of silence that surrounded the [[Holocaust]], especially in [[Israel]], until the Eichmann trial. Many young people lived in the shadow of these events, but could find no answers to their inevitable questions, whether from their parents or their teachers. For most of adolescents, the only answers they could find were in the book ''[[The House of Dolls]]'' ([[1955 in literature|1955]]) by [[Yehiel De-Nur|K. Tzetnik]], a then-anonymous survivor of [[Auschwitz]] who wrote about women prisoners forced into prostitution by the [[Nazi]] guards—his book was later alleged to be a work of fiction. Nevertheless, it had an impact on young Israeli males as they went through puberty: questions of identity and their parents' violent past melted into their emerging sexual identity, often fostering graphic S&amp;M fantasies.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} This became more prevalent during the highly publicized Eichmann trial, when these same young people were exposed to detailed descriptions of the concentration and death camps for the very first time. K. Tzetnik himself was one of the witnesses who provided graphic testimony during the trial. 

Exploiting these trends, a group of Israeli publishers began to publish [[dime novel]]-format memoirs, describing abuse, particularly sexual abuse, in the concentration camps. Sold in magazine kiosks, the novels, ostensibly first-person memoirs, became best-sellers. According to filmmaker [[Ari Libsker]], &quot;the Holocaust pictures that I saw, as one who grew up here, were of naked women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cinephil.co.il/_Uploads/416NY_Times_Stalags.pdf| title=Israel's Unexpected Spinoff| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| author=Isabel Kershner| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]| date=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These had a marked impact on an otherwise puritanical society, and the books quickly became bestsellers. 

They disappeared almost as quickly as they appeared. Within two years of the appearance of the first publication, the publishers were accused by an Israeli court of distributing pornography, and the books were discontinued. Although still available underground, certain titles earned the ire of the establishment, and efforts were made to find and destroy them. 

In 2007, the genre re-entered public debate in Israel after Israeli filmmaker [[Ari Libsker]] featured the books in a documentary film, ''[[Stalags (film)|Stalags]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinephil.co.il/Index.asp?CategoryID=77&amp;ArticleID=416 cinephil.co.il]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Jlps pink.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jesus Loves Porn Stars]]

'''XXXchurch.com''' is a non-profit organization that aims to help those who struggle with [[pornography]]. Its target is consumers and those in the pornography industry. The organization, whose slogan is the &quot;#1 Christian Porn Site&quot;, launched in January 2002 when the founders, Mike Foster and Craig Gross, set up a booth inside the [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] to promote the [[website]] as an alternative to porn. They annually attend shows worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://xxxchurch.com/07/pornpatrol/index.php&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has received support from prominent [[Christian]] pastors such as [[Bill Hybels]] and [[Rob Bell]] and has also been deemed controversial by other Christian leaders.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The organization gives its vision as:
&quot;XXXchurch is the #1 Christian porn site designed to bring awareness, openness and accountability to those affected by pornography.  We are an online community that tours the world speaking at colleges, churches and community centers. XXXchurch.com exists to help those who are in over their heads with pornography, both consumers and those in the industry.&quot;

==Jesus Loves Porn Stars==
XXXchurch has gained national press coverage and notoriety through exhibiting at pornography conventions across the world. The group passes out [[Bible]]s with &quot;Jesus Loves Porn Stars&quot; on the front. They have given away thousands of Bibles at porn conventions, and this facet of their ministry has been featured in US national media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1191829,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwLcg-mxHeQ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Porn Debate==
The founder of XXXchurch.com, Craig Gross, regularly debates with porn star [[Ron Jeremy]] in an event called &quot;The Porn Debate&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://porndebate.com/&lt;/ref&gt; on college campuses across the US. In the summer of 2007, the duo embarked on a theater tour across the eastern US. In 2008, the debate was featured on ABC News' ''Nightline'' both on air and online, with the segment becoming the most watched in Nightline's online viewing history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abcnews.go.com/Nightline/FaceOff/&lt;/ref&gt;

==X3Watch==
XXXchurch.com also offers [[accountability software]] called [http://x3watch.com X3Watch]. The software logs all questionable websites that a user accesses based on content type and then sends a report to an &quot;accountability partner&quot; of the person's choosing. The program is free to download without tech support but a premium version is offered that includes support for a small donation.&lt;ref&gt;http://X3watch.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The software can be turned off at any time. An uninstall or turn off of the software is logged in the email reports. The goal of the software is for individuals to be open, honest and accountable to each other with their web surfing.

==XXXchurch.tv==
In 2008 the organization launched a video podcast that documents the current campaigns of XXXchurch. It is released every two weeks on XXXchurch.tv and [[iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://xxxchurch.tv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
XXXcurch has several radio public service announcements airing across the US and abroad on various radio staions and syndicated programs such as [[RadioU]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvulive.com/radiou/riot2.htm RadioU&lt;/ref&gt;, The Full Armor Of God Broadcast&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullarmorradio.com/home The Full Armor Of God Broadcast&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Refuge Radio]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refugeradio.com/Events/details.cfm?ID=867 Refuge Radio&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Malone University]] Radio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malone.edu/1446 Malone University Radio&lt;/ref&gt; and Fuel Radio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuelradio.fm/index.php Fuel Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Popular Culture==

The origins of XXXchurch were documented in a film called ''Missionary Positions''.&lt;ref&gt;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6125906980763324273&amp;q=missionary+positions&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular [[Internet meme]] &quot;[[Every time you masturbate... God kills a kitten]]&quot; was used by XXXchurch.com's &quot;Operation: Save the Kittens&quot;, which used the video to talk about [[masturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xocPtKaRcD8&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Gross appeared on an episode of [[MTV|MTV's]] [[True Life]], In which he counseled a man addicted to porn.

'''Berl Kutchinsky''' (1935 - 1995) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] Professor of [[Criminology]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=age/&gt;&lt;ref name=bocaraton&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Europe debates control of child porn import |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zNgPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kI0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6807,3748188&amp;dq=berl-kutchinsky |work=[[Boca Raton News]] |publisher= |page=6|date=1984-09-16 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became internationally famous for his studies in the [[public health effects of pornography]].

He was based in Denmark, which in 1969 became the first country to legalize [[hardcore pornography]]&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/19/1063625202157.html |title=X-rated?

Over the next two decades Kutchinsky carried out extensive research into crime statistics in the three countries.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; His findings were that increased availability of pornography had not led to an increase in [[sexual violence]].&lt;ref name=age/&gt; He found that the incidence of certain sex crimes had in fact fallen, including rates of [[child sexual abuse]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name=age/&gt;

His first work on the subject, ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'' (1970), was a scientific report ordered by the United States' [[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]]. It found that the legalizing of pornography in Denmark had not (as had been expected) resulted in an increase in sex crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html Berl Kutchinsky: ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 he helped to draft the law which banned [[child pornography]] in Denmark; after which according to him, &quot;Child porn has largely disappeared from Denmark.&quot;&lt;ref name=bocaraton/&gt; Berl Kutchinsky's last book, ''Law, pornography, and crime: The Danish experience'', was edited by his colleague Annika Snare and published posthumously in 1999.

== Biography ==
=== Personal life ===
Pipe was born in October 1967 &lt;ref name=adultfilmfan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adultfilmfan.com/rogerpipe/rogerpipeinterview.php|title=Interview with Rog T. Pipe|author=Cousin Stevie|publisher=adultfilmfan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[San Marcos, California|San Marcos]] &lt;ref name=rog2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/interviews/Shay_Jordan.asp|title=Interview with Shay Jordan|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in southern California.  He went to [[Cal-State Fullerton]] and graduated with a degree in Communications &lt;ref name=MySpace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/rogtpipe|title=Rog T. Pipe's MySpace Home Page|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=myspace.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Pipe is currently married, and has been for 15 years. His wife is consistently referred to only as “Mrs. Rog,” &lt;ref name=rog3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/news/read_article.asp?sku=4069|title=Happy 15th Anniversary Mrs. Rog!|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is supportive of his career &lt;ref name=serenity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldofgoddess.com/rogerpipeinter.htm|title=Interview with Rog T. Pipe|author=Serenity|publisher=theworldofthegoddess.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  He has confirmed that he has children, but their names and ages have not been revealed.  He has also stated that Mrs. Rog does occasionally join him in watching porn, though not nearly as often as he would like. &lt;ref name=&quot;adultfilmfan&quot;/&gt;

=== Career ===
Pipe began watching pornography consistently starting in 1985. &lt;ref name=&quot;adultfilmfan&quot;/&gt; It wasn’t until 1995, while doing a search on the internet for a rare porn title, that he stumbled across a website where individuals were discussing and reviewing pornographic titles.  After several days, Pipe decided that he would try his own luck by reviewing movies from his private collection, writing “from the heart of a porn fan.” &lt;ref name=&quot;adultfilmfan&quot;/&gt; The response was seemingly overnight, and soon, Pipe’s reviews were being included on distributor websites to establish a more personal connection with those buying the videos. 

Eventually, Pipe launched [http://www.rogreviews.com Rog Reviews] in 1998, intending only to showcase his reviews, a decision made partially in retaliation against the [[Adult Video News Awards]], for which he had briefly worked for.  The experience left Pipe jaded against the more mainstream avenues, but has since worked out to be “very beneficial.”  Pipe has said in interviews that the same individual who dismissed him ([[Mark Kulkis]]) has ensured Pipe’s accessibility to every major adult film premiere for the companies he represents, suggesting that while they way in which they parted was not ideal, there still held an attraction to his ability to write. &lt;ref name=&quot;serenity&quot;/&gt;

During the early years of the site’s launch, Pipe also had a day job as a warehouse and office manager for a local software company. &lt;ref name=&quot;serenity&quot;/&gt;  At this time, Pipe also worked on several amateur scripts, the most hugely popular being “Guilty Pleasures,” which Pipe failed to receive credit for in the final cut. &lt;ref name=rog4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/reviews/read_review.asp?sku=899|title=Review of Guilty Pleasures|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, Pipe began including sex toy and website reviews, enticing outside free-lance reviewers to contribute, the most prolific of which is midwestern college co-ed Savana Switzer.

In 2005, Pipe joined [[The Daily Noise]], an uncensored entertainment radio talk show broadcast out of [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], hosted by spin jocks Kaan Soler and Jimmy Diggs, as a weekly guest commentator.  The Daily Noise folded in late August 2007, signaling the end of a successful three-year run.  Prior to the Daily Noise, Pipe also had a number of appearances on the radio show “Lovebytes,” hosted by [[Dr. Bob Berkowitz]] on Eyada.com, and had been in the process of negotiating a deal for his own news show when Eyada went off the air. &lt;ref name=serenity&gt;{{cite web|url=&gt;[http://www.theworldofgoddess.com/rogerpipeinter.htm|title=Interview with Rog T. Pipe|author=Serenity|publisher=theworldofthegoddess.com}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Earlier this year, Pipe introduced interviews with industry members through podcasts, a decision which has increased his site’s exposure considerably.  In addition to the podcasts, his site also offers textual transcripts of the interviews, galleries of industry giants and amateur fans, and a wide selection of reviews of websites and sex toys.

==== Views on the Industry ====
Despite being at the heart of the industry, Pipe grapples with the implications of porn in regards to the long-term effects it can have on its stars, urging aspiring actors and actresses to be absolutely sure they want to get involved in adult entertainment &lt;ref name=rog5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/news/read_article.asp?sku=4118|title=Savana Switzer's Five-Question Interview with Rog T. Pipe|author=Savana Switzer|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  However, Pipe maintains he is one of the most open-minded in the business, believing that “all women, in all shapes, sizes and ages should be appreciated by the men who appreciate them. As far as perfect sizes, I’m the wrong guy to ask. My idea of perfect varies from woman to woman…I find beauty in just about every shape and size.” &lt;ref name=&quot;serenity&quot;/&gt;

Pipe has also voiced his frustration about the treatment of women within the industry, criticizing many as being hurt by the “Jackassization,” (a term referring to the [[MTV]] show, &quot;[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]],&quot; which popularizes a group of individuals performing dangerous—and arguably, degrading—stunts for laughs and shock effect) of many of the industry’s most popular films. &lt;ref name=rog6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/reviews/read_review.asp?sku=4108|title=Review of the Movie Down the Hatch 19|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of [[HIV]] among five actors (beginning with [[Darren James]]) in the spring of 2004, Pipe expressed his disappointment that the advent of the Internet had opened up the door for anyone to shoot, which can exclude those involved from being in safe, professional environments and circumstances. &lt;ref name=&quot;adultfilmfan&quot;/&gt;.  He did, however, commend the industry for avoiding replicating the mistakes of the previous outbreak in 1999 (where [[Tricia Devereaux]] and [[Brooke Ashley]] were blamed for “venturing outside the industry” until it was revealed that the infected &quot;Patient X&quot; was actually star [[Mark Wallice]] &lt;ref name=&quot;adultfilmfan&quot;/&gt;) and for companies such as Platinum X covering the cost to continually test their talent.

==== Professional Relationships and Disputes ====
Pipe admits to sustaining several “professional crushes,” the most publicized of which has been contemporary starlet [[Aurora Snow]]. &lt;ref name=rog7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/interviews/aurora_snow3.asp|title=Interview with Aurora Snow|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he's referred to [[Shay Jordan]] as his 'next ex-Mrs. Rog' &lt;ref name=rog2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/interviews/shay_jordan_07.asp|title=Interview with Shay Jordan|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He also reveres former adult superstar [[Christy Canyon]], who starred in many porn movies during the 80's, identified as his &quot;first porn crush.&quot; He’s also expressed that his favorite stars of all-time are Kaitlyn Ashley and Tom Byron.

However, Pipe has also been at the heart of several controversies in the adult entertainment industry, including a public feud with director Skeeter Kerkove. Though the exact nature of the dispute has never been revealed, it is widely believed it resulted from Kerkove’s ex-wife, former adult actress and director [[Bridgette Kerkove]], tossing a drink in Pipe’s face. &lt;ref name=rog9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/news/read_article.asp?sku=4050|title=Anyone know a good lawyer?|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she later called Pipe and apologized for the incident, Kerkove has continued to deny Pipe’s version of events. &lt;ref name=adultfyi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adultfyi.com/read.php?ID=23600|title=Skeeter: Roger T. Pipe Owes Otto Bauer an Apology; T. Pipe a &quot;hang-around&quot; says Skeeter|author=Gene Ross|publisher=adultfyi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry exploded in July of this year, when porn gossip columnist Gene Ross blogged about a conversation he had with Kerkove, who swore that Snow had told him she had slept with Pipe in a secret [[point of view pornography]] scene to get ahead in the industry and likewise contended that lesser-known actress [[Layla Jade]] had also shot a secret scene with Pipe. &lt;ref name=&quot;adultfyi&quot;/&gt; Pipe responded to the allegations, stating “No such scene was ever shot. Come on....if I had shot that, everyone would know about it. I would be showing everyone on the freaking planet. That isn't the sort of thing you hide from.” &lt;ref name=adultfyi2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adultfyi.com/read.php?ID=23589|title=Roger T. Pipe Adds Comments|author=Gene Ross|publisher=adultfyi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although Snow and Jade have remained silent on the issue publicly, adult film star and director [[Jay Ashley]] (who also happens to be Snow’s boyfriend) defended Pipe and Snow against Kerkove’s statements, insisting that Snow has “earned everything she got,” and that the story of a secret scene between Pipe and Snow has no credibility or substance. &lt;ref name=adultfyi3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adultfyi.com/read.php?ID=23707|title=Jay Ashley: Aurora Snow and Roger T. Pipe - No Way, Jose|author=Gene Ross|publisher=adultfyi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerkove attempted to further fan the flames by shooting a scene in October specifically ‘dedicated’ to Pipe. &lt;ref name=adultfyi4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adultfyi.com/read.php?ID=23625|title=Skeeter: 'Rog T. Pipe, this bar stool's for you!'|author=Gene Ross|publisher=adultfyi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homage is in tribute to a review Pipe had written for the movie “Triple Threat,” in which he characterized two characters having sex on a barstool as coming from “a page in the [[Jules Jordan]] handbook” &lt;ref name=rog10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/reviews/read_review.asp?sku=3706|title=Review of the Movie Triple Threat|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Kerkove and “Triple Threat” director [[Otto Bauer]] (during the Aurora Snow controversy) each expressed their resentment of his critique, despite the fact the review had been posted over two years earlier. &lt;ref name=&quot;adultfyi&quot;/&gt;. The argument was resurrected again with another tangent directed at Pipe, but has since died down. &lt;ref name=adultfyi5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adultfyi.com/read.php?ID=23636|title=Otto Bauer: I Hate to Sully Jules Jordan's Name Through This Moron Roger T. Pipe|author=Gene Ross|publisher=adultfyi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the 2008 [[Adult Entertainment Expo]], according to Pipe's website, he and Bauer had a chance to bury the hatchet. &lt;ref name=rog11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adultfyi.com/read.php?ID=23636|title=Rog's AEE Journal: Day 2 Nikita Denise, Savana Interviews Aurora, Teagan &amp; Meet Otto Bauer|author=Roger T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pipe wrote on his website:

''As some of you may recall, Otto had a few words for me on Gene’s site last summer. I didn’t comment much at the time because I’ve never met Otto and certainly have nothing against him. Since that I time I had been looking forward to a face to face. I introduced myself and asked Otto for one minute to set the record straight. He granted me that minute, listened as explained to him that some of the things he was told I said did not come from me. Otto listened to me, shook my hand and said “I don’t have a problem with anything you have said. I have a problem with things you didn’t say. So we have no problem.” We talked for a few minutes about the review in question, the way things get fucked up and agreed that from now on, we have no been and that both of us would talk to rather than about one another. I couldn’t have been happier with how things went.''

Pipe has also had some public exchanges regarding former adult film superstar, [[Asia Carrera]] &lt;ref name=&quot;serenity&quot;/&gt; However, when Carrera’s husband, nutritionist and author [[Don Lemmon]], died in a car crash in June 2006, Pipe solicited his readers for financial and emotional support for the grieving Carrera &lt;ref name=rog11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogreviews.com/news/read_article.asp?sku=3275|title=Asia Carrera Update|author=Rog T. Pipe|publisher=rogreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Naked Women's Wrestling League''', also known as '''NWWL''', is [[Pornographic]] company which features naked females battling in the ring.  Aside from the naked wrestling, another attraction to the show was the hostess – [[Carmen Electra]].

==History==

The show made its debut in 2004 with the release of the [[pay-per-view]] show &quot;Vegas Stripped&quot;. It returned to pay-per-view in 2006, with the &quot;Naked Revolution&quot; show. This time out, Carmen Electra hosted the show, while other celebrities to appear on the program included legendary pro-wrestling manager [[Jimmy Hart|Jimmy &quot;Mouth of the South&quot; Hart]] as well as adult entertainment star [[Mary Carey (pornographic actress)|Mary Carey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwwl.com/index.php/news/nwwl-news/57-call-for-fans-opinions-on-the-mary-carey-issue.html|title=Call For Fan’s Opinions On The “Mary Carey Issue”  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since the show began, the NWWL wrestlers have been featured in [[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]], [[Playboy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwwl.com/index.php/news/nwwl-news/59-nwwl-in-playboy-magazine.html|title=NWWL In Playboy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwwl.com/index.php/news/nwwl-news/58-nwwl-ladies-featured-in-maxmen-magazine.html|title=NWWL Ladies Featured in Maxmen Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; magazines as well as on [[CBS News]] and countless radio show interviews.

In 2007, Carmen Electra announced a lawsuit against the NWWL for, among other things, [[breach of contract]] and failure to pay money that she claimed was still due to her. In response, NWWL owner [[Howard Mann]] made it public that she had been paid all money due to her and that her claims were without merit.

In late 2007, the NWWL launched a new website – NWWL.com – where their nude wrestling matches are available for [[download]]. 

As of April 2008, the league appears to be alive and well, producing new content and touring live shows in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cndb.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=44889|title=CNDB thread on NWWL}} '''''CAUTION: Nudity'''''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry''''' is 
the third [[portrait photography ]] book by American photographer [[Michael Grecco]]. It is published by Rock Out Books (ISBN 0979331404). The book contains over 200 photographs of actors, filmmakers and personalities in the world of [[sex industry|adult entertainment]].  Grecco photographed his subjects during the 2007 [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], the convention which surrounds the annual [[AVN Awards]].  The book's forewords, written by rock musician [[Dave Navarro]] and [[Hustler]] magazine editor [[Larry Flynt]], discuss modern culture's acceptance of pornography into the mainstream, which allows an overtly sexual work like this to be considered a [[coffee table book]].

Included among the portrait subjects are [[Larry Flynt]], [[Jenna Jameson]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Chi Chi LaRue]], [[Tera Patrick]], [[Alexandra Silk]], [[Katsuni]], [[Sunny Lane]], [[Kurt Lockwood]], and Michelle Aston. Uncommon in pornography-related works, the photographs do not seem to have been altered with any significant [[image editing]] or [[photo manipulation]], thus avoiding the layer of fantasy usually applied to actors in this field.

''Naked Ambition'' was edited by former ''RIP magazine'' editor [[Lonn Friend]] and former ''[[FHM]]'' editor Rob Hill.

Female actressess of the MILF porn genre are usually women ages 25 to 50 and some of the actresses have started making [[Pornographic film|pornographic movies]] at 35 and older. Central to the typical MILF [[narrative]] is an [[Ageplay|age-play]] dynamic of older women and younger lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-10-30/columns/the-rise-of-milfs-and-mommies-in-sexual-fantasy-material/ | title= The Rise of MILFs and Mommies in Sexual-Fantasy Material |last=Taormino |first=Tristan|date=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MILF genre is one of the fastest growing segments in porn today.&lt;ref name=Deauxma1&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.xrentdvd.com/Porn_Star_Interviews/Deauxma.html | title= Inside Deauxma |last= |first= |date=01/10/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known online reference is a 1995 [[Usenet]] post about a ''[[Playboy]]'' pictorial of attractive [[mother]]s.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/sexandlove/30915/ | title= Of MILF and Men |last= |first= |date=Apr 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other term used in the genre is the [[Age disparity in sexual relationships#Slang terms|cougar]] that implies an older woman as predator.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pornography addiction''', or more broadly '''overuse of pornography''', is excessive pornography use that interferes with daily life.
There is no diagnosis of ''pornography addiction'' in the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), and as with the broader proposed diagnosis of [[sexual addiction]], there is debate as to whether or not the behaviors indicate an [[addiction]].&lt;ref name=Downs&gt;{{cite web |last=Downs |first=Martin F. |coauthors=Louise Chang, MD (reviewer) |title=Is Pornography Addictive? Psychologists debate whether people can have an addiction to pornography. |publisher=[[WebMD]] |url=http://men.webmd.com/guide/is-pornography-addictive |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis as an addiction==
===Dispute about whether or not pornography addiction exists===
There is dispute about whether pornography addiction exists.
There is further argument as to whether or not it has harmful effects.
Some sex therapists argue that it is a real addiction with serious consequences, while others argue it is not comparable to substance addiction and should not be classed as such.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Who, What, Why? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7371171.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Magazine &amp;#124; Does sex addiction exist? |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erick Janssen]], PhD, a researcher at the [[Kinsey Institute]], criticizes the application of the term addiction to pornography overuse, arguing that while it describes addiction-like behaviour, treating the users as addicts may not help.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downs&quot;/&gt;
[[Stephen Andert]], coauthor of &quot;Web Stalkers: Protect Yourself from Internet Criminals &amp; Psychopaths&quot;, states &quot;For many people, pornography is a problem. Like alcohol, gambling or drugs, it can take control of a person's life  and drag them kicking and screaming or voluntarily into the gutter.  The addictive and progressive (or should that be regressive) nature of pornography is well documented.&quot;
However, Andert identified no source for the claimed documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Andert|first=Stephen|coauthors= Donald K. Burleson|title=Web Stalkers: Protect Yourself from Internet Criminals &amp; Psychopaths|publisher=Rampant TechPress|year=2005|pages=339|location=page 359,|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zuqR3KglZfsC&amp;dq=Web+Stalkers&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proposed definition ===
Aviel Goodman, M.D., proposed general characteristics of all types of addictions in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;addiction1990def&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Aviel|date=1990|journal=British Journal of Addiction|title=Addiction: Definition And Implications|location=pages 1403-1408|volume=85|issue=11|language=English|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119381659/PDFSTART|issn=0952-0481|accessdate=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pornography addiction is defined, by those who argue that it exists, as a [[psychological addiction]] to, or [[Dependence (behavioral medicine)|dependence]] upon, [[pornography]], characterized by obsessive viewing, reading, and thinking about pornography and sexual themes to the detriment of other areas of one's own life.

== Proposed stages of pornography addiction ==
Some psychologists and sex therapists (for example [[Kimberly Young]], PhD, and [[Victor Cline]], PhD) have proposed stages in pornography addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;&gt;

[[Serial killer]] [[Ted Bundy]] stated that his pornography addiction went through stages.
As a boy he reported seeing [[softcore pornography]], and that he later viewed [[hardcore pornography]] and [[violent pornography]].

== Online pornography addiction ==
Online pornography addiction involves pornography obtained via the [[Internet]].
Psychologists who support this concept argue that it is stronger, and more addictive, than ordinary pornography addiction because of its wide availability, explicit nature, and the privacy that online viewing offers.
Some claim that &quot;addicts&quot; regularly spend extended periods of time searching the internet for new or increasingly hardcore pornography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downs&quot;/&gt;

===Use of content control and monitoring===
Some clinicians and support organizations recommend using voluntary [[Content-control software|content control mechanisms]] (also known as &quot;Internet filters&quot; and &quot;censorware&quot;), internet monitoring, or both as a tool in the treatment of purportedly excessive online pornography use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper1999&quot;

Sex researcher Alvin Cooper and colleagues suggested several reasons for using filters as a therapeutic measure, including [[curbing]] accessibility that facilitates problematic behavior and encouraging clients to develop coping and relapse prevention strategies.&lt;ref name=cooper1999/&gt; Cognitive therapist Mary Anne Layden suggested that filters may be useful in maintaining environmental control.&lt;ref name=layden2005/&gt; Internet behavior researcher David Delmonico noted that, despite their limitations, filters may serve as a &quot;frontline of protection.&quot;&lt;ref name=delmonico1997/&gt;

Filters that target pornography have been included in computer operating systems such as [[Linux]] and are sold as stand-alone applications and devices.

'''Sexting''' (a [[portmanteau]] of '''[[Human sexual behavior|sex]]''' and '''[[text messaging|texting]]''') is the act of sending sexually explicit messages or photos electronically, primarily between cell phones.

==Background==
Sexting was reported as early as 2005 in the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]] Magazine'',&lt;ref name=SunTele&gt;{{cite news |title=The One and Only |author=Yvonne Roberts |date=2005-07-31 |accessdate=2009-01-14 |page=22 |quote=Following a string of extramarital affairs and several lurid &quot;sexting&quot; episodes, Warne has found himself home alone, with Simone Warne taking their three children and flying the conjugal coop.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been described as taking place worldwide.&lt;ref name=NZ&gt;{{cite news|title=Teen 'sexting' alarms cyber-safety experts |publisher=[[The Press]] |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2009-01-14 |author=Phil Hamilton |page=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=SunTele/&gt;, Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student knickers in a not; 'Sexting' shocks parents, police |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2009-01-14 |publisher=[[mX (newspaper)|mX]] |author=Inga Gilchrist}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name=NZ/&gt; the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite news|title=Sexting |author=Gigi Stone |publisher=[[World News with Charles Gibson|World News Saturday]] |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Canada]].

A January 2009 survey of 1,200 teenagers by [[Burlington, VT|Burlington]], [[Vermont]] television station [[WCAX]] claimed that one in five had sent explicit photos of themselves.&lt;ref name=WCAX&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Your Child &quot;Sexting&quot;? |url=http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=9612361&amp;nav=menu183_2 |author=Keagan Harsha |publisher=[[WCAX-TV]] |date=2009-01-03 |accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sociologist at [[Colorado College]] interviewed 80 children and believes this claim is overblown; she claims; &quot;I had them go through their last ten messages, their last ten photos and I never saw it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sociologist: Few teens 'sexting' |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/01/11/Sociologist-Few-teens-sexting/UPI-78141231654189/ |date=2009-01-11 |accessdate=2009-05-06 |publisher=[[United Press International|UPI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2009 UK survey found that 38% of under-18s had &quot;received an offensive or distressing sexual image via text or email&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'', 7 August 2009, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/07/sexting-teenagers-mobile-phones You don't know what sexting is?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
Sexting is a result of advances in technology enabling new forms of social interaction.  Messages with sexual content have been exchanged over all forms of historical media.  Newer technology allows photographs and videos, which are intrinsically more explicit and have greater impact.  A social danger with sexting is that material can be very easily and widely promulgated, over which the originator has no control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=719928 |publisher=National Nine News |title=Kids face porn charges over 'sexting' |accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Responsible Online and Cell-Phone Communication [http://www.iroc2.org (I.R.O.C.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)] is a New Jersey based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to educating communities about proactively protecting themselves online with digital responsibility through their [http://www.sextingisstupid.com &quot;Sexting is Stupid&quot;] program.

==Legal cases==
In 2007, 32 Australian teenagers from the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were prosecuted as a result of sexting activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malice in Wonderland |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/malice-in-wonderland/2008/08/09/1218139163632.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2009-01-14 |author=Liz Porter |publisher=[[The Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child pornography]] charges were brought against six teenagers in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]] in January 2009 after three girls sent sexually explicit photographs to three male classmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexting craze leads to child pornography charges |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/14/child-pornography-sexting |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2009-01-14 |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a Virginia assistant-principal was charged with possession of child pornography and related crimes after he had been asked to investigate a rumored sexting incident at the high school where he worked.  Upon finding a student in possession of a photo on his phone that depicted the torso of a girl wearing only underpants, her arms mostly covering her breasts, the assistant principal showed the image to the principal who instructed him to preserve the photo on his computer as evidence, which he did.  While the court later ruled that the photo did not constitute child pornography because under Virginia law, nudity alone is not enough to qualify an image as child pornography; the image must be &quot;sexually explicit&quot;. Loudoun County prosecutor James Plowman stands by his initial assessment of the photo and says he would not have pursued the case if the assistant principal would have agreed to resign.

==Legislative responses==
Vermont lawmakers introduced a bill in April 2009 to legalize the consensual exchange of graphic images between two people 13 to 18 years old.

In Ohio, a county prosecutor and two lawmakers proposed a law that would reduce sexting from a [[felony]] to a first degree [[misdemeanor]], and eliminate the possibility of a teenage offender being labeled a sex offender for years.  The proposal was supported by the parents of Jessie Logan, a Cincinnati 18-year-old who committed suicide after the naked picture of herself which she sexted was forwarded to people in her high school.&lt;ref&gt;Dick Russ, ''[http://www.wkyc.com/print.aspx?storyid=111478 Ohio to address 'sexting' laws]'', WKYC-TV (Apr. 13, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Porn groove''' (or '''porno groove''') is a term used to describe the music [[soundtrack]] to [[Pornographic movie|pornographic films]], or a [[Music genre|genre]] of music that imitates such music. The [[electric guitar]] with [[wah-wah pedal]] is the most common instrument associated with porn groove, and synonymous with the genre. Simple, often [[minimalist music|minimalistic]]-sounding drums, with the [[rim knock]] sound being commonly associated with porn groove. In some movies such as the popular and influential ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', the film is cut with the music in mind, making the 'thrust' in the scenes 'flow' with the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_22/Deep_Throat.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080105051415/http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_22/Deep_Throat.aspx |archivedate=2008-01-01 |title=Archive - ''Deep Throat'' |work=[[Fused Magazine]] |quote=Gerard Damiano edited the film to its music, so the actions would match and the beat would match…like up and down strokes on the old shaft…it was pretty clever.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porn groove is often thought of as quite [[wikt:tacky|tacky]] music.

'''''Lost Girls''''' is a [[graphic novel]] depicting the sexual adventures of three important female fictional characters of the late 19th and early 20th century: [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', [[Dorothy Gale]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and [[Wendy Darling]] from ''[[Peter Pan]]''. They meet as adults in 1913, and describe and share some of their erotic adventures with each other. The story is written by [[Alan Moore]], and drawn by [[Melinda Gebbie]] (who also created and drew ''[[Cobweb (comics)|The Cobweb]]'' series of stories for ''[[Tomorrow Stories]]'', part of Moore's [[America's Best Comics]] line).

==Plot summary==
[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] from ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (now a grey-haired old woman named &quot;Lady Fairchild&quot;), [[Dorothy Gale]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (now in her 20s) and [[Wendy Darling]] from ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (now named &quot;Wendy Potter&quot;, in her 30s, and married to a man named Harold Potter who is 20 years older) are visiting an expensive mountain resort hotel in [[Austria]] on the eve of [[World War I]] (1913–1914). The hotel, named &quot;Hotel Himmelgarten&quot;, is run by a man named ''Monsieur Rougeur''. At the hotel, Dorothy meets a man named ''Captain Rolf Bauer''.

The women meet by chance and begin to exchange erotic stories from their pasts. 

The stories are based on the childhood fantasy worlds of the three women:
*'''Wendy, John, and Michael Darling''' meeting a [[homeless]] boy named Peter Pan, his sister, and the lost boys in a park for sexual encounters one summer, when she was sixteen. 
*'''Dorothy Gale''' having sexual encounters with three [[farm|farm hand]]s and later her father at the age of sixteen after a [[cyclone]] came to [[Kansas]]; it was while trapped in her house during this cyclone that she experienced her first [[orgasm]]. 
*'''Alice Fairchild''' having sex, first with a man and then with several girls and women while attending an [[Single-sex education|all girls school]], beginning at the age of fourteen.

In addition to the three women's erotic flashbacks, the graphic novel depicts sexual encounters between the women and other guests and staff of the hotel, as well as with each other. The erotic adventures are set against the backdrop of cultural and historic events of the period, such as the debut of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' and the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]].

==Literary significance and reception==
Moore is one of the most critically acclaimed writers in the field of [[comic books]], and the release of this work received widespread coverage in the industry media. Despite the price of US$75, the book's first two print runs of 10,000 each sold out at the distributor level on the day of their release, with the U.S. sales at the end of 2007 reaching 35,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/9848.html ICv2 News - 'Lost Girls' at 35k&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy about child sexuality===
''Lost Girls'' has come under fire from critics who have argued that the book's controversial sexual content involving children might open up stores that carry the book and people who buy the book to be charged with possession and/or trafficking in [[child pornography]]. Many retailers have stated that they will not stock the book out of fear of possible obscenity prosecution, though some said they might make the book available to their customers via special order and simply not stock the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Rich Johnston]]|work=Comic Book Resources|title=Lying in the Gutter Volume 2 Column 54|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&amp;article=2475|dateformat=mdy |accessdate=May 31 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States prosecution for production or sale of &quot;obscene&quot; material would require failing the [[Miller test]]. Although child pornography is classified as obscene, that requires the involvement of a child in its production,&lt;ref&gt;Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 http://www.politechbot.com/docs/cppa.text.html&lt;/ref&gt; which the book did not include. The legal situation in other countries is less clear: some countries forbid any images of nude children in a sexual context, regardless of how they were produced. French publisher [[Delcourt (publisher)|Delcourt]] temporarily suspended their plans to publish a translated edition in 2008, citing concerns about the legality of the depictions of minors under French law.

Moore states that the storm of criticism which he and Gebbie expected did not materialize, which he attributes in part to his design of ''Lost Girls'' as a &quot;benign&quot; form of pornography (he cites &quot;people like [[Angela Carter]] who, in her book ''[[The Sadeian Women]]''... admitted... the possibility [of] a form of pornography that was benign, that was imaginative, was beautiful, and which didn’t have the problems that she saw in a lot of other pornography&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Padraig&quot;&gt;The [[Forbidden Planet (bookstore)|Forbidden Planet]] International Blog Log: &quot;We’re off to see the Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Northampton: Part 1&quot; Interview with Alan Moore by Pádraig Ó Méalóid, June 13th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as inspirations for the work).  He has also said that his own description of ''Lost Girls'' as &quot;pornography&quot; has &quot;wrong-footed a lot of... people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Padraig&quot;/&gt; Moore speculates that &quot;if we’d have come out and said, 'well, this is a work of art,' they would have probably all said, 'no it's not, it's pornography.' So because we're saying, 'this is pornography,' they're saying, 'no it's not, it's art,' and people don't realise quite what they've said.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Padraig&quot;/&gt;

In the UK, graphic artists and publishers fear that the book could be illegal to possess under the [[Coroners and Justice Bill]], which criminalises any sexual image depicting a &quot;child&quot;. Even though the characters are over the [[age of consent]], the new law defines &quot;child&quot; to be anyone appearing under the age of 18, which means that pages from the novel could fall foul of the law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/graphic-artists-condemn-plans-to-ban-erotic-comics-1652270.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputed copyright status===
On [[June 23]], [[2006]], officials for [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]]—which was given the [[copyright]] to ''Peter Pan'' by [[J. M. Barrie]] in 1929—asserted that Moore would need their permission to publish the book in the UK (and by implication, elsewhere in the [[European Union]]). Moore indicated that he would not be seeking their licence, claiming that he had not expected his work to be &quot;banned&quot; and that the hospital only holds the rights to performances of the original play, not to the individual characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2238812,00.html &quot;Comic row over graphic Peter Pan&quot;], ''[[The Times]]'', [[June 23]], [[2006]]. Accessed [[2 June]] [[2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; On [[11 October]] [[2006]], Top Shelf signed an agreement with GOSH that did not concede copyright infringement, but delayed publication of ''Lost Girls'' in the UK until after the copyright lapsed at the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MattBrady|work=Newsarama|title=Top Shelf, Ormond Street Hospital Settle Over Peter Pan in Lost Girls|url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=88979|dateformat=mdy |accessdate=October 27 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allusions and references==
The title of the work is a play on the name for Peter Pan's followers, the [[Peter Pan#The Five Lost Boys|Lost Boys]].

The individual sections dealing with the three titular &quot;girls&quot; all have distinct visual layouts and themes used for their chapters. Alice's sections feature ovals reminiscent of her [[mirror|looking-glass]]; Wendy's are shrouded in tall, dark rectangles reminiscent of the shadowy Victorian-architecture of her time, and Dorothy has wide panels in imitation of the flat landscape of [[Kansas]] and prominently featured silver shoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stuyoung.blogspot.com/2008/02/lost-girls.html Stuart Young's review of Moore &amp; Gebbie in conversation with Stewart Lee, London, October 12, 2006]. Accessed June 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore attempts to tailor the dialogue to each character's previous experiences and stories. Dorothy Gale, raised on a farm speaks in a casual Midwestern American dialect. Wendy's speeches are heavy with timidity and clumsiness as a result of the repressive nature of her middle-class upbringing. Alice, having briefly been made queen (in ''Through The Looking-Glass And What Alice Found There''), is more authoritarian in her upper-class English speech patterns and formal manner. [[Lewis Carroll]]'s nonsense-words also make allusory appearances in Alice's dialogue, including phrases such as &quot;to jab&quot;, &quot;bandersnatch&quot; and &quot;contrarywise&quot; as well as more overt references to her adventures in phrases like &quot;the reflection is the real thing&quot; and &quot;I made pretence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v3_3/lost_girls/kidd.shtml &quot;ImageSexT: A Roundtable on ''Lost Girls'': Down the Rabbit Hole&quot; by Kenneth Kidd, 2007]. Accessed June 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the three ''Lost Girls'' volumes opens with a quotation from the three &quot;original&quot; authors ([[Lewis Carroll]], [[J.M. Barrie]], [[L. Frank Baum]]). Parts of these citations are used as titles for each book:
#First volume: Older Children (&quot;We are but older children, dear, who fret to find our bedtime near,&quot; Carroll.)
#Second volume: Neverlands (&quot;Of course, the Neverlands vary a good deal,&quot; Barrie.)
#Third volume: The Great And Terrible (&quot;I am Oz, the great and terrible. Who are you and why do you seek me?,&quot; Baum.)
Equally, the titles of each chapter naturally point towards the three &quot;original&quot; authors' books: &quot;The Mirror&quot;, &quot;Silver Shoes&quot;, &quot;Missing Shadows&quot;, &quot;A Vice From a Caterpillar&quot;, &quot;Which Dreamed It?&quot;, &quot;The Cowardly Lion&quot;, &quot;You Won't Forget to Wave?&quot;, &quot;Queens Together&quot;, &quot;Snicker Snack&quot;, etc.

Each volume has ten chapters, and each chapter contains eight pages. This format initially derived from its original serialized publication in [[Stephen R. Bissette]]'s anthology ''[[Taboo (comic)|Taboo]]'', but it also reflects Carroll's multi-layered usage of mathematical allusions and links as there are 8 squares in the length of a chess board (a prominent feature of ''Through The Looking-Glass'', and the key to becoming a queen in both game and book) as well as his poem ''The Hunting Of The Snark'' being ''An Agony In '''Eight''' Fits''.

The regular chapters are interspersed with pornographic [[pastiche]]s of works by artists and authors of the period, presented as chapters in Monsieur Rougeur's ''White Book'', a collection of illustrated pornographic stories. Each chapter is in the style of different authors and artists of the period: these include presentations in the styles of [[Colette]] and [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and [[Alfons Mucha]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Egon Schiele]], and [[Pierre Louÿs]] and [[Franz von Bayros]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/08/30/moore/ &quot;Lost Girls&quot; reviewd by Douglas Wolk for ''Salon'', August 30, 2006].

==Literary themes==
===Sex===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a genre whose literary and artistic quality he and Gebbie hope to raise:

{{cquote2|Certainly it seemed to us [Moore and Gebbie] that sex, as a genre, was woefully under-represented in literature. Every other field of human experience—even rarefied ones like detective, spaceman or cowboy—have got whole genres dedicated to them. Whereas the only genre in which sex can be discussed is a disreputable, seamy, under-the-counter genre with absolutely no standards: [the pornography industry]—which is a kind of [[Bollywood]] for hip, sleazy ugliness.|[[Alan Moore]]|interview with ''[[Science Fiction Weekly]]''&lt;ref name=SFW /&gt;}}

===Shared universe===
A [[fictional crossover]] placing the protagonists of unconnected stories in a shared universe is a standard trope of [[superhero]] comics, a genre that Moore has written in fairly extensively.  [[Philip José Farmer]]'s works featuring the [[Wold Newton family]] is a previous example of taking established classic characters and retroactively placing them in [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] with each other. While working on ''Lost Girls'', Moore also used this concept as the basis for his series ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''.

===Shelter from the storm===
The plot device of a group of people being sequestered together in a hotel or similar place telling stories or committing otherwise decadent acts while the outside world is falling apart or in chaos is an old one in Western storytelling. Moore draws heavily on themes and tropes from such books as the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s ''[[120 Days of Sodom]]'', and [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', the latter of which sees a young German man staying in a mountain hotel/sanatorium for seven years just prior to World War I. This novel, like ''Lost Girls'', sees that war as a major turning point in world history.

==Publication history==
The first six chapters of ''Lost Girls'' were initially published in the ''[[Taboo (comic)|Taboo]]'' anthology magazine, beginning in [[1991 in comics|1991]] with ''Taboo'' #5.&lt;ref name=taboo5&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=122231|title=''Taboo'' #5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=taboo6&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=105265|title=''Taboo'' #6}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=taboo7&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=122255|title=''Taboo'' #7}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Kitchen Sink Press]]'s [[Tundra Publishing|Tundra]] imprint later reprinted the ''Taboo'' chapters as two separate volumes, containing all of the previously-published chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=7567|title=''Lost Girls'' (1995)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ten-issue series was scheduled at one point, but Moore and Gebbie instead decided to take the time to finish it, then offer it to various companies as a finished product. Eventually [[Top Shelf Productions|Top Shelf]] was selected as the publisher, and at one point the finished product was meant to be released in late 2003 or early 2004. Top Shelf later planned to debut it in the U.S. at the 2005 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], but due to graphic design taking longer than anticipated, it was released at the July [[2006 in comics|2006]] convention instead. In the U.K. the book was published on [[1 January]] [[2008]], and launched by Moore and Gebbie at a book launch in London on [[2 January]].

Over the course of the book's sixteen-year production, Moore and Gebbie entered into a romantic relationship, and in 2005 they announced their [[engagement]] to be [[matrimony|married]]. &quot;I'd recommend to anybody working on their relationship that they should try embarking on a 16-year elaborate pornography together,&quot; joked Moore. &quot;I think they'll find it works wonders.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/51180 Alan Moore | The A.V. Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore originally planned to write in his usual style, producing a lengthy script from which Gebbie would work, but after some initial attempts they decided &quot;to collaborate much more closely. So, she would construct the pages of artwork from my incoherent thumbnail sketches and then I would put the dialogue in afterwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readysteadybook.com/Article.aspx?page=alanmoore Alan Moore « Interview « ReadySteadyBook - a literary site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a collaboration is known in comic book circles as writing [[Marvel Method|Marvel style]].

'''''Reefer Madness: Sex, Drugs, and Cheap Labor in the American Black Market''''' is a book written by [[Eric Schlosser]] and published in 2003. The book is a look at the three pillars of the [[underground economy]] of the [[United States|U.S.]], estimated by Schlosser to be ten percent of American GDP: [[marijuana]], [[migrant labor]], and [[pornography]]. 

In ''Reefer Madness'', Schlosser argues, based on usage, historical context, and consequences, for the decriminalization of marijuana.  In ''In the Strawberry Fields'', he explores the exploitation of illegal immigrants as cheap labor, arguing that there should be better living arrangements and humane treatment of the illegal immigrants America is exploiting in the fields of California.  ''An Empire of the Obscene'' details the history of pornography in American culture, starting with the eventual business magnate [[Reuben Sturman]].  Schlosser closes by arguing that such a widespread black market can only undermine the law and is indicative of the discrepancy between accepted mainstream American culture and its true nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Joanna Angel, Luke 3.JPG|thumb|right|Altporn model [[Joanna Angel]] at the [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo|Adult Entertainment Expo 2007]]]]
'''Alt porn''' (also known as '''alt-porn''', '''altporn''', '''alternaporn''', or simply '''alt''') is a shortening of &quot;[[Alternative culture|alternative]] [[pornography]]&quot;. Alt porn tends to involve members of such [[subculture]]s as [[Goth subculture|goth]]s, [[Punk subculture|punks]], or [[rave party|ravers]] and is often produced by small and independent websites or filmmakers. It often features [[Model (person)|model]]s with [[body modification]]s such as [[tattoo]]s, [[piercing]]s, or [[scarification]]s, or temporary modifications such as dyed hair. The term '''indie porn''' is also sometimes used, though this term is more generally used as a synonym for [[independent pornography]], regardless of affinity with any kind of alternative subculture.

== History ==
While pornography specifically oriented toward alternative culture did not arise until the 1990s, the work of [[Gregory Dark]], [[David Aaron Clark]], [[Michael Ninn]], and [[Stephen Sayadian]] are seen by some as predecessors of alt porn. The [[Cinema of Transgression]] of [[Richard Kern]] and [[Nick Zedd]] (as well as Kern's later photographic work) can also be viewed as early examples of alt porn. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueblood.net/2006/10/punk-art-porn-vivid-vca-eros-zine/ &quot;Corporate Red Tape on My Mouth and the Punk Art Porn Allstars&quot;] by Amelia G, ''BlueBlood.net'', October 29th, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackbookmag.com/Features/2006/Issue_45/Altporn.aqf &quot;Altporn: Just Because it Looks Punk Rock, Doesn’t Mean it Is&quot; ] by Brandon Stosuy, ''[[BlackBook Magazine|BlackBook]]'' magazine (website) #45, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Richard+Kern/ &quot;Richard Kern&quot;] (interview) by Daniel Robert Epstein, ''SuicideGirls'', September 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first venue explicitly devoted to &quot;subcultural erotica&quot; was [[Blue Blood (magazine)|Blue Blood]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueblood.com/about_us_blueblood.html &quot;About Us&quot;], BlueBlood.com.&lt;/ref&gt;, a glossy magazine that began in 1992 and featured models with a [[Goth subculture|goth]] or [[cyberpunk]] look. The biggest market for alt porn, however, has been on the Internet. Other than a few ephemeral personal websites, the earliest explicitly alt porn site was Blue Blood's [http://www.gothicsluts.com GothicSluts.com ], in early 1999 followed shortly after by Raverporn.net (later renamed [http://www.eroticbpm.com EroticBPM.com]) in July of the same year, and later followed by NakkidNerds in December. [http://www.supercult.com [[Supercult]]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supercult.com 'Supercult']&lt;/ref&gt; began in 2000, followed by [[Suicidegirls|SuicideGirls]] in late 2001, which has grown to become the most popular and financially lucrative alt porn site. With the success of SuicideGirls, the number of alt porn sites has grown enormously since 2002.&lt;ref name=mies&gt;[http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?SID=1633026052F9A518A6C11A42349DEB1A&amp;DSN=nsrc_dsn&amp;Mode=EDIT&amp;Article=631&amp;ReturnURL=1 &quot;Evolution of Alternative: History and controversies of the alt-erotica industry&quot;] by Ginny Mies, ''[[American Sexuality]]'', September 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://altporn.net/2007/04/28/altporn-altporn-genre-history-timeline/ &quot;AltPorn: AltPorn Genre History Timeline] (part 1) by Beeker the StatsNrrd, ''Altporn.net'', April 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://altporn.net/2007/05/15/altporn-altporn-genre-history-timeline-2/ &quot;AltPorn: AltPorn Genre History Timeline&quot;] (part 2) by Beeker the StatsNrrd, ''Altporn.net'', May 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the above-mentioned sites, well-known altporn websites in operation as of September 2008 include [http://deviantnation.com Deviant Nation], [[Burning Angel]], and [[GodsGirls]].

The terms &quot;alternative porn&quot; or &quot;alt porn&quot; were coined in the early 2000s in reference to SuicideGirls, RaverPorn, and similar sites; longer-standing projects, such as Blue Blood, generally used terms such as &quot;subcultural [[erotica]]&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/altporn/673.html untitled comment by Forrest Black], ''altporn [[LiveJournal]] community'', February 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alt porn websites are often distinguished by their use of [[message boards]], [[blogs]], [[social networking]], and other features of [[online community]], encouraging participation by both models and viewers. While these features are not exclusive to alt porn sites, more typical [[porn sites]] tend to feature more or less anonymous models who are viewed by anonymous visitors.

Alt porn-themed videos are also become a growing niche in the [[adult video]] market. The work of directors Stephen Sayadian and Gregory Dark during the 1980s and early 1990s had many of the features of later alt porn and are often cited as an influence on current alt porn video. In 2001, two [[Amateur pornography|amateur]] videos under the title ''Technosex'' were produced, featuring women involved in the [[rave]] scene and a [[techno]] music soundtrack. Since 2004, director [[Eon McKai]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0546,taormino,69982,24.html &quot;The Prince of Alt-Porn&quot;] by [[Tristan Taormino]], ''[[Village Voice]]'', November 11th, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; has been producing alt porn-themed videos for [[VCA Pictures]], an otherwise mainstream adult video studio, and in 2006 was signed by [[Vivid Entertainment]] to produce alt porn-themed videos under the Vivid-ALT imprint. Vivid-ALT has also signed noted fetish photographers [[Dave Naz]] and [[Winkytiki|Octavio &quot;Winkytiki&quot; Arizala]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainews.com/story/10106 &quot;Vivid Forms Vivid-Alt To Distribute Eon Mckai&quot;] press release by Vivid PR, ''Adult Industry News'' (website), February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gramponante.com/2006/05/vivid-wins-alt-war-without-shot-being.html &quot;Vivid wins Alt war without shot being fired&quot;] by Gram Ponante, ''Porn Valley Observed'' (website), May 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

Many members of the alt porn community disagree on the definition of alt porn. Some consider it mostly an [[aesthetic]] quality while others see it as having a more [[Ideology|ideological]] definition. This includes controversies over whether alt porn sites and videos should restrict themselves to [[softcore]] [[pin-up]] photography or include more sexually explicit [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] content, whether alt porn need be explicitly [[feminist]] or not, and whether alt porn venues should present models of all genders and a range of body types rather than just conventionally attractive young women.&lt;ref name=mies/&gt; Since every pornography company conducts its business and treats its models differently, it is hard to define it on an ideological basis, although the models' freedom to speak their mind both about the industry, their employers, and political agendas is considered by some to be a vital part of the alt porn community. [[SuicideGirls]] have been criticized for restricting their employees' ability to make public comments of this nature. This led to a very public falling out between the owners of SuicideGirls and a number of their former models,&lt;ref name=mies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandphoenix.com/features/other_stories/documents/05018238.asp &quot;SuicideGirls revolt&quot;] by Deirdre Fulton, ''[[Portland Phoenix]]'', October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/01.04.06/suicidegirls-0601.html &quot;Obscene But Not Heard&quot;] by Peter Koht, ''[[Metroactive]]'', January 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and larger debates as to whether alternative porn was inherently any more empowering than mainstream porn.

Created in March 2009, '''Carnalpedia''' is &quot;the largest [[sex]] encyclopedia on the Internet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carnalpedia.org/Carnalpedia&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is a combination of [[carnal knowledge]] and [[encyclopedia]], and is free-of-cost to view or edit. Carnalpedia is not free to distribute.

While the largest encyclopedia on sex, Carnalpedia lacks many key topics on sex and consists almost entirely of articles related to the [[sex industry]], with many of the articles on [[pornographic actor]]s and [[pornographic film]]s provided by [[AEBN]]. This narrow focus is similar to [[Wikipedia]]'s founding in 2001, with the original source of articles from the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], providing an encyclopedia that also lacked articles on many key topics. Also like Wikipedia, Carnalpedia is a [[wiki]], which enables users to expand existing articles and create new articles.

Carnalpedia uses [[Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP)|Restricted to Adult]] labels which allows software programs such as [[NetNanny]] to block inappropriate content from underage visitors.

'''Pierre-François Hugues d'Hancarville''' is a [[France|French]] pseudo-aristocrat ([[Nancy]] 1719 - Padua 1805). Son of a bankrupt cloth merchant of Nancy, Hancarville was born Pierre-Francois Hugues, adding the title ‘Baron’ and the aristocratic surname Hancarville himself. An amateur [[art dealer]] he introduced [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]] to the Porcinari family, whose collection of antiquities Hamilton purchased forming the basis of the collection that was subsequently sold to the British Museum.  With Hamilton he edited ''Les Antiquités d'Hancarville'' published in 4 volumes 1766-67, a collection of vases and other antiquities from the excavations at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]]; one of the most beautiful books ever made, it was influential in informing the emerging taste for [[neoclassicism]] and inspired reproductions from pottery manufacturers such as [[Wedgwood]]. In 1769 Hancarville was forced to flee his creditors in Naples.

Hancarville also produced two pornographic volumes under fictitious imprints: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Monumens de la vie privée des XII Césars d’apres une Suite de Pierres et Medailles Gravées sous leur regne ([[Capree|Capri]], chez [[Sabellus]], 1780) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Monumens du culte secret des dames romaines (&quot;Rome. De l'Imprimerie du Vatican, 1787&quot;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These were widely pirated, in variously incompetent editions, during his lifetime.

{{Sex and the Law}}
'''&quot;Extreme pornography&quot;''' is a term introduced by the [[UK Government]] in Part 5, Section 63 of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_1 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; which made possession of such images a criminal offence from 26 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Ozimek |title=Government finally names the day for porn ban |curly=y |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/26/pr0n_ban_date/ |publisher=The Register |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New offence of possession of extreme pornographic images |curly=y |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement261108a.htm |publisher=Ministry of Justice |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to [[pornography]], defined as an image &quot;of such a nature that it must reasonably be assumed to have been produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal&quot;, which is &quot;grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character&quot;, and portrays any of the following:
* (a) an act which threatens a person’s life,
* (b) an act which results, or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person’s anus, breasts or genitals,
* (c) an act which involves or appears to involve sexual interference [[necrophilia|with a human corpse]],
* (d) a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or [[oral sex]] [[bestiality|with an animal]] (whether dead or alive),
&lt;!--This is meant to be a new line, as this sentence applies to all four clauses, and is cited directly from the act--&gt;and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that any such person or animal was real.

The term covers staged acts, and applies whether or not the participants consent.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-extreme-porn-3008051/ Government consultation] states &quot;whether or not they notionally or genuinely consent to take part&quot;; and &quot;actual scenes or realistic depictions&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 Explanatory Notes] state the Government's opinion that the partipants' consent is not legally valid (see [[Operation Spanner]]) and hence not a justification under this new law (803); and states &quot;In the case of images of staged activity , the Government believes that banning possession is justified...&quot; (804).&lt;/ref&gt; Classified works are exempt, but an extract from a classified work, if the image was extracted for the purpose of sexual arousal, would not be exempt. Whether an image is &quot;pornographic&quot; or not is up to the magistrate or jury to determine simply by looking at the image; it is not a question of the intentions of those who produced the image.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidance&quot;/&gt; If an image is held in a person's possession as part of a larger series of images, the question of whether it is pornographic is also determined by the context in which it appears. Therefore an image might be legal in some contexts, but not in other contexts. Serious injury is not defined by the act, but is up to the magistrate or jury.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidance&quot;/&gt; The bill gives examples of acts which would be covered: depictions of hanging, suffocation, or sexual assault involving a threat with a weapon; the insertion of sharp objects into or the mutilation of breasts or genitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/en/08en04-g.htm Criminal Justice And Immigration Act 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of &quot;obscene&quot; is not the same as that used in the [[Obscene Publications Acts]], which requires that an image &quot;deprave and corrupt&quot; those likely to view it; instead this is the ordinary dictionary definition of &quot;obscene&quot;. &quot;Grossly offensive&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot; are given as examples of &quot;obscene&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidance&quot;/&gt;

There is a defence for the defendant if he can prove that he &quot;directly participated&quot; in the act, and where the participants consented, but only if the acts are those that can be legally consented to in the UK (see [[Operation Spanner]]). This defence is also not available to the photographer, or other &quot;onlookers&quot; who were present, but did not directly participate.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidance&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Further information on the new offence of Possession of Extreme Pornographic Images |curly=y |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/extreme-pornographic-images.pdf |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/extreme-pornographic-images.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-11 |publisher=Ministry of Justice |accessdate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where (a) or (b) apply, the maximum sentence is 3 years; otherwise the maximum is 2 years. Adults sentenced to at least two years will be placed on the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register]].

As a specific technical term, it appears to have been introduced in [[England]] following the death of [[Jane Longhurst]] in [[2003]] caused by [[Graham Coutts]] who was obsessed with such depictions downloaded from web sites dedicated to such content.

== History ==
After [[Graham Coutts]]'s conviction in February 2004, the Government and police forces called for &quot;violent&quot; adult pornography sites to be shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blunkett to urge US web porn curb |curly=y |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3515797.stm |publisher=BBC |date= 24 February 2004 |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MP calls for violent porn ban |curly=y |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/3471441.stm |publisher=BBC |date=9 February 2004 |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK police seek web porn crackdown |curly=y |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3460855.stm |publisher=BBC |date=5 February 2004 |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Longhurst]]'s mother and sister launched a campaign against such sites. A petition promoted by MP [[Martin Salter]] which gained 50,000 signatures was submitted to the government demanding a ban of &quot;extreme internet sites promoting violence against women in the name of sexual gratification&quot;.

The Government was unsuccessful shutting down such sites, since they are based in other countries (e.g., the United States), and are legally made with consenting adults. In August 2005, the British government consulted on instead criminalising the possession of such images.

On [[30 August]] [[2006]], the government published the results of the consultation and announced its intention to introduce a possession ban on all extreme pornography as soon as the legislative timetable allows. Opinions on the proposals were sharply divided in the consultation, with 61% (241 out of 397) of responses rejecting the need for stronger laws in this area, and 36% in favour (3% gave no opinion). The proposed maximum penalty for possession of these images was three years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation on the possession of extreme pornographic material |curly=y |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/cons-extreme-porn-3008051/Gvt-response-extreme-porn2.pdf?view=Binary |publisher=[[Home Office]] |date= August 2006 |accessdate=19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[26 June]] [[2007]], the government published the plans as part of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill. The bill extended the scope of the proposals from &quot;serious, disabling injury&quot; to &quot;serious injury&quot;.

The law came into force on [[26 January]] [[2009]].

In July 2009, [[Baroness O'Cathain]] proposed an amendment to the [[Coroners and Justice Bill]] that would bring in an equivalent law for &quot;extreme pornographic writings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldbills/033/amend/su033-ivb.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/06/dangerous_writings_endangered/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uses ===

A 20 year old St Helens man was prosecuted for having &quot;extreme&quot; images involving women and animals on 10 February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/4427000.Man_guilty_of_animal_porn_image_charges/&lt;/ref&gt; The images were reported by a PC repair shop. He was given an 18-month supervision order, 24 hours at an attendance centre, and had to pay costs of £65.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/4445020.Man_had__grossly_offensive_and_disgusting__porn_images_on_computer/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/26/dangerous_pictures_act/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2009, The Register claimed that, according to their sources within law enforcement, there have been two or three prosecutions against people selling Chinese pirated DVDs, which include some bestiality DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/06/16/extreme_pr0n_convictions/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July, 2009, Alan Moore from [[Carrickfergus]], [[Northern Ireland]] was arrested under the extreme pornography law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8167351.stm|title=First 'extreme porn' court case|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=24 July, 2009|accessdate=24 July, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scotland ===

In 2004 in Scotland, a committee of [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]]  backed a call to ban adult pornography as the [[Equal opportunity|Equal Opportunities]] Committee supported a petition claiming links between porn and sexual crimes and violence against women and children.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3975523.stm MSPs back pornography ban calls]&quot;, BBC News, 2 November 2004. Retrieved 29 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A spokeswoman said &quot;While we have no plans to legislate we will, of course, continue to monitor the situation.&quot; In 2007, MSPs looked again at criminalising adult pornography, in response to a call from [[Scottish Women Against Pornography]] for pornography to be classified as a hate crime against women. This was opposed by [[Feminists Against Censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.scotsman.com/topstories/MSPs-set-to-take-close.3344392.jp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6334167.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Scotland announced its own plans to criminalise possession of &quot;extreme&quot; pornography, extending the law further, including [[Rape pornography|depictions of rape imagery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revitalising Justice - Proposals To Modernise And Improve The Criminal Justice System |curly=y |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/09/24132838/4 |publisher=Scottish Government |date= September 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
The Government consultation stated that &quot;the material may often cause serious physical and other harm to those involved in making it; in some cases the participants are clearly the victims of criminal offences&quot;.  The consultation did not attempt to estimate the frequency of these events, and there is no evidence that such content is being distributed at all. The law would cover images whether or not the participants consented, and would include not only images where extreme violence is taking place, but also fictitious images where people are role playing such violence.

Material is considered extreme pornography only if the main purpose of creating it was to produce sexual arousal.  This rules out most mainstream films, documentaries, war footage or instructional videos, regardless of content, though these would be included if images were extracted from them for the purpose of sexual arousal. Textual material or cartoon depictions are also excluded regardless of theme or detail.

The consultation stated &quot;it is possible that such material may encourage or reinforce interest in violent and aberrant sexual activity to the detriment of society as a whole&quot; but also that they do not have &quot;sufficient evidence from which to draw any definite conclusions as to the likely long term impact of this kind of material&quot; and that there was an &quot;absence of conclusive research results as to its possible negative effects&quot;.

The consultation cited the case of [[Graham Coutts]] who killed Jane Longhurst, suggesting a link between violent pornography and the murder.  Coutts had previously accessed websites that offered such pornography, although he had been practicing [[erotic asphyxia]] for five years before exposure to such material, and had told psychiatrists in 1991 that he feared his thoughts may lead to criminal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/6756863.stm Musician 'had murderous thoughts']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government also wishes to criminalize possession of the material in order to attempt to reduce the risk of children coming into contact with it. The consultation cited a study which reported &quot;57% of all 9-19 year olds surveyed who use the Internet at least once a week had come into contact with pornography online&quot;, but it did not distinguish between different forms of pornography, and the government has no plans to criminalize all pornography for the same reason.

In discussing the 2006 quashing of the conviction of Coutts, Jane Longhurst's purported killer, a barrister supporting the ''backlash'' stance observed:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backlash-uk.org.uk/news.html backlash &quot;News&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Lord Hutton's judgment points out that Coutts had engaged in breath play sexual games with previous partners years before he started to use internet porn. The Judge commented that if the same Defendant guilty of the same conduct been tried before the same jury, but without the evidence that he used internet porn, the jury would have been very likely to accept that he did not intend to kill. It is hard to escape the conclusion that the Judge thought the evidence that Coutts used porn prejudiced the jury and led to unfounded assumptions about Coutt's intent. What this judgment shows is that the obsession with criminalizing the users of porn will further prejudice juries and lead to miscarriages of justice.}}

In September 2007 the Government published a Rapid Evidence Assessment by [[Catherine Itzin]], [[Ann Taket]] and [[Liz Kelly]], investigating &quot;the evidence of harm relating to exposure to extreme pornographic material&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/research280907.htm The evidence of harm to adults relating to exposure to extreme pornographic material - Ministry of Justice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This was criticised in a statement signed by over forty academics as being &quot;extremely poor, based on contested findings and accumulated results. It is one-sided and simply ignores the considerable research tradition into &quot;extreme&quot; (be they violent or sexually explicit) materials within the UK's Humanities and Social Sciences.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backlash-uk.org.uk/acad_statement.html backlash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law has been criticised as likely breaching Articles 8 and 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backlash-uk.org.uk/qcopinion.html backlash QC opinion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/CJIBlords2Rbriefing21jan08.pdf Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government also states this, but believes &quot;this is justified as being in accordance with the law, and necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime, for the protection of morals and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/130/en/07130x-n.htm#index_link_206 House of Commons - Explanatory Note&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government has conflated the issue with participants being abused in the production of such images, with Martin Salter claiming the existence of [[snuff film]]s where women are raped and murdered on camera in [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2007-10-08b.59.1 Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill: 8 Oct 2007: House of Commons debates (TheyWorkForYou.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/law_order/back+in+the+chain+gang/2604382]{{dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no such examples of images have been shown to exist, and the sites referred to by the Government are instead those produced in the UK and US with consenting actors (see &quot;Sites labelled as &quot;extreme pornography&quot;&quot;, below).

The law has been criticised for criminalising images where no crime took place in their creation. In the House of Lords debates, [[Lord Wallace of Tankerness]] stated &quot;Having engaged in it consensually would not be a crime, but to have a photograph of it in one's possession would be a crime. That does not seem to me to make sense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2008-04-21a.1336.2 Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill: 21 Apr 2008: House of Lords debates (TheyWorkForYou.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The law has also been criticised for covering images of consenting adults, for example including some forms of [[BDSM]] or [[bondage pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2008-03-03a.873.3 Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill: 3 Mar 2008: House of Lords debates (TheyWorkForYou.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pawscave.dircon.co.uk/IML/beef.htm &quot;LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN&quot; - January 2009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7370807.stm BBC NEWS | Magazine | 'I am not doing anything wrong'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the organisation [[Comic Shop Voice]] said that the law may result in the ban certain comic books, such as ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' and several collections of [[manga]]. They said in a statement: &quot;Because this is a minefield for the law it then falls on the Police to enforce it, and it is their judgement that could lead to a prosecution. We COULD get to a point where the police could legitimately visit your home or workplace, and sanctioned by an un-elected magistrate or judge go through your collection and if they find any comic book that they feel will cause sexual arousal or displays extreme violence then they could arrest you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swaine|first=Batman|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/4370072/New-pornography-laws-could-make-comic-books-illegal-claim-campaigners.html|title=New pornography laws 'could make comic books illegal', say campaigners|publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]''|date=2009-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites labelled as &quot;extreme pornography&quot;==

Examples of Internet sites accessed by Graham Coutts include &quot;necrobabes&quot; &quot;deathbyasphyxia&quot; and &quot;hanging bitches&quot;.

===Necrobabes===
Necrobabes is a website hosting images of women pretending to be dead. The site is subtitled &quot;erotic horror for adults&quot;. Necrobabes was included as an example of a site that relatives of [[Jane Longhurst]], who was murdered by [[Graham Coutts]], thought should be banned.

Membership of Necrobabes was used as evidence in the murder trial of Patrick Anthony Russo, a Texas Church leader, who murdered Diane Holik in 2001. During the subsequent police investigation it was found out that Russo had been a paying subscriber to Necrobabes. Partly because of his Necrobabes membership and other evidence found from his computer, including browser history and web searches for &quot;[[Asphyxia|asphyx]]&quot;, Russo was found guilty of strangling Holik to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/06/21/throttling-priest-had-internet-murder-fantasy | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071013031511/http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/06/21/throttling-priest-had-internet-murder-fantasy | archivedate =2007-10-13 | title = Theinquirer.net: Throttling priest had internet murder fantasy| date =2007-06-21 | accessdate =2008-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://news.cnet.com/Police-Blotter-Necrobabes.com-leads-to-murder-conviction/2100-1047_3-6192232.html | title = Police Blotter: Necrobabes.com leads to murder conviction| date =2007-06-21 | accessdate =2008-05-26 }} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/Police-Blotter-Necrobabes.com-leads-to-murder-conviction/2100-1047_3-6192232.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Russo was given a life sentence.

However, the site owners assert &quot;The material we produce is fanciful, even cartoonish in many regards; there is nothing realistic about it. Our viewers know this. Far from normalizing violence, it relegates it squarely into the realm of fantasy.&quot; It states that scenes are simulated, and that no one was harmed during the making of our photo stories and videos. They claim that, contrary to the aforementioned petition, they &quot;do not encourage nor condone real-life violence against others&quot;.  The site states that there is no pornography on the site, and claims that it is exempt from the recordkeeping requirements of [[Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act|18 U.S.C. § 2257]], because there are no images of actual sexually explicit conduct.

The site is registered with the [[Internet Content Rating Association|ICRA]] so that it can be blocked by [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]]'s Parental Controls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.necrobabes.com/ Necrobabes.com - Adults Only&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legality ====

Necrobabes is hosted in the United States and has been online since [[1997]]. The UK Government has attempted without success to get the US authorities to shut down sites such as Necrobabes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/2004/03/week_1/07_terror.html C4 News - Home - Anti-terrorism - Blunkett meets Ashcroft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such images are legal in the US, and it has been claimed they would be hard to ban without violating the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2004/mar/09/usnews.internationalnews US and UK crack down on web porn | Technology | guardian.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hanging bitches ===

The site hangingbitches.com was run by Frans van der Hulst. The site was closed, but he has since opened more sites. The images are produced in the United Kingdom with British model actors who have been shown alive and unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23434300-details/Revealed:+The+ultra-violent+sex+movies+being+made+in+Milton+Keynes/article.do Revealed: The ultra-violent sex movies being made in Milton Keynes| News | This is London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consenting Adult Action Network]] is a growing grassroots network which opposes the law and any other legislation that restricts the sexual choices of consenting adults. It has organised protests against the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7682319.stm |title=Porn protesters hit Westminster |accessdate=19 November 2008 |publisher=BBC News |date=21 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pandora/pandora-bondage-protest-set-to-spice-up-the-commons-967685.html |title=Bondage protest set to spice up the Commons |accessdate=19 November 2008 |publisher=The Independent |date=21 October 2008 |first=Henry |last=Deedes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;www.postchronicle.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=96&amp;num=179572&lt;/ref&gt;

|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The determination of what is obscene is up to a jury in a trial, which must apply the [[Miller test]]; however, due to the prominence of [[pornography]] in most communities most pornographic materials are not considered obscene by the Miller Test. 

In 1967, [[Denmark]] decriminalized pornography with few adverse effects, and the following year, the United States Supreme Court held that people could view whatever they wished in the privacy of their own homes. These two developments contributed in part to Congress creating the [[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]] in 1968 to investigate the effects of obscenity and pornography on the people of the United States.  Each member of the Commission was appointed by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In what became the most detailed and comprehensive investigation into pornography to date, the Commission in its final report found that pornography could not be shown to do harm to individuals or to society, and recommended the repeal of obscenity and pornography legislation as it related to adults. Released during the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]] the report generated a brief bout of controversy but was ultimately ignored by the administration. 

Attorney General for Ronald Reagan, [[Edwin Meese]], also courted controversy when he appointed the &quot;[[Meese Commission]]&quot; to investigate pornography in the United States; their report, released in July 1986, was highly critical of pornography and itself became a target of widespread criticism. That year, Meese Commission officials contacted convenience store chains and succeeded in demanding that widespread men's magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' be removed from shelves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://home.earthlink.net/~durangodave/html/writing/Censorship.htm | title=Politics and Pornography | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; a ban which spread nationally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediacoalition.org/reports/wildmon.html | title=The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; until being quashed with a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] admonishment against prior restraint by the D.C. Federal Court in Meese v. Playboy (639 F.Supp. 581).

In the United States in 2005, Attorney General Gonzales made obscenity and pornography a top prosecutorial priority of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Acosta&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Acosta replied that this was Attorney General Gonzales' mandate.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative religious organization Concerned Women for America polled every U.S. attorney’s office to find out what they planned to do about obscenity. Except for a handful of offices that didn’t return calls, not one said it had any inclination to pursue anything other than child obscenity cases.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''pornographic actor/actress''' or a '''porn star''' is a person who appears in [[pornographic films]]. Most [[actor]]s appear [[nude]] in films (usually filmed in explicit sexual [[List of pornographic sub-genres|genres]]). Most genres have specialists who achieve most of their recognition in a specific niche market such as [[lesbian sex]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[pegging (sexual practice)|strap-on sex]], [[anal sex]], [[double penetration]], [[semen swallowing]] or 'teenage' women.

Some legal jurisdictions consider commercial [[pornography]] a form of [[prostitution]], though most commercial sex film performers do not regard themselves as prostitutes for various reasons, but rather as artists. Most notably these performers are not paid directly by their sexual partners for the sex, but both are paid through a studio.  

==History==

Many performers had appeared in various sex films since the beginning of photography. Many so-called &quot;[[penny arcade (venue)|penny arcade]]s&quot; of the early 1900s had early hand-cranked films and &quot;rotoscope&quot; (Holmes-style [[Stereoscope]]) glasses that featured &quot;racy&quot; pictures of women, mostly in topless pictures, though a few actually showed women in full frontal nudity with fewer still showing them in actual sexual couplings.

There have been many films and photographs that showed sexual acts including the [[World War II]] series of erotic German home movies known as the &quot;Sachsenwald films,&quot; recorded secretly in Nazi Germany 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1146258,00.html|title=Porn und Drang|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=[[2004-02-12]]|accessdate=2007-04-18|work=[[The Guardian]]|quote=Before submitting his manuscript to his publisher last summer, Kunkel had researched long and hard into one of the most subterranean aspects of the Nazi era - a series of erotic home movies known as the Sachsenwald films, shot secretly in 1941. Officially, pornography was forbidden under the Nazis; in reality, however, the films were not only screened privately for the amusement of senior Nazi figures, but were also traded in north Africa for insect repellent and other commodities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers in these early photograph and film recordings usually chose to remain anonymous due to social pressure and legal sanctions against open sexual actions.

Common wisdom holds that the first generally acknowledged porn star with specific (stage) name recognition was [[Linda Lovelace]] from the United States, who starred in the 1972 feature ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. However, [[Casey Donovan (actor)|Casey Donovan]], star of the first mainstream pornographic hit ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'' in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =40 Years of Gay History: the Early Seventies|publisher =Advocate.com|url =http://www.advocate.com/40/timeline70_74.asp|accessdate =  2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieved name recognition nearly a year before ''Deep Throat'' debuted. The success of ''Deep Throat'', which grossed hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide, spawned a slew of other films and pornographic film stars such as [[Marilyn Chambers]] (''[[Behind the Green Door]]''), [[Gloria Leonard]] (''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]''), [[Georgina Spelvin]] (''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]''), and [[Bambi Woods]] (''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'').

This era has been termed by some to be ''[[The Golden Age of Porn]]'' when porn films were being shown in public theaters and thus accepted for public consumption or at least tolerated for such.&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4053/is_200210/ai_n9085969 Second wave: Feminism and porns golden age]. ''Radical Society'' Oct 2002 by Loren Glass&lt;/ref&gt; This time frame lasted until the late 1970s, with some saying the early 1980s, whereby these sex films had specific story-plots and promotional budgets and the performers became notable. Such legendary performers of this era include [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]], [[Ginger Lynn Allen]], [[Veronica Hart]], [[Nina Hartley]], [[Seka]], and [[Amber Lynn]], who became well known in this era.

The ability for people to view adult movies in the privacy of their own homes, owing to the popularity of the [[VCR]] (and later [[DVD]]) created a new adult market that exceeded the scope of the previous theatre centric era. Additionally, the prevalence of the [[Internet]] served as a catalyst for the increased sale of pornography. 

Some state that the production values of adult films have decidedly declined in the attempt to create a constant amount of new films to fulfill the ever increasing demand. Others argue that sex films are merely being more true to their source as some have stated that people only watch these films in order to see these performers have sex.

As a result of this, there are hundreds of adult film companies today, releasing tens of thousands of directly recorded-on-video with minimal sets, including so-called web cam recordings annually, with thousands of people working on both sides of the camera to meet the demand for these films.

==Legal challenges==
Attempts were made in the 1970s to outlaw pornography in the [[United States]] by prosecuting porn stars for [[prostitution]]. The courts in California were where the case was initially made, and stopped short of advancing the case to the [[United States Supreme Court]] for a final decision. It was this decision and acceptance to let stand whereby the California Court made a legal distinction in the case of [[People v. Freeman]] between someone who took part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone who takes on the act of merely ''portraying'' role where a sexual relationship was engaged in on-screen act as part of their acting performance. It is this specific legal distinction between pornography and prostitution in California law that has allowed California to become the porn center of the United States.

At present, no other state in the United States has either implemented or accepted this legal distinction between commercial pornography performers versus prostitutes as shown in the Florida case where sex film maker Clinton Raymond McCowen, aka &quot;Ray Guhn&quot;, was indicted on charges of &quot;soliciting and engaging in prostitution&quot; for his creation of pornography films which included &quot;McCowen and his associates recruited up to 100 local men and women to participate in group sex scenes, the affidavit says.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.xbiz.com/news_piece.php?id=15700 | title= Webmaster Ray Guhn Arrested in Florida | accessdate=2006-06-26 | publisher=''xbiz.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction that California has in its legal determination in the Freeman decision is usually denied in most states' local prostitution laws, which do not specifically exclude performers from such inclusion.

In some cases, some states have ratified their local state laws for inclusion to prevent California's Freeman decision to be applied to actors who are paid a fee for sexual actions within their state borders. One example is the state of [[Texas]] whose prostitution law specifically states:

:An offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or pay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a person to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/cqcgi?CQ_SESSION_KEY=WUAZIBSLSMKR&amp;CQ_QUERY_HANDLE=125100&amp;CQ_CUR_DOCUMENT=9&amp;CQ_TLO_DOC_TEXT=YES

==Actresses==
There is a hierarchy of female performers. According to actor-turned-director [[Jonathan Morgan (actor)|Jonathan Morgan]], &quot;The girls could be graded like A, B and C. The A is the chick on the boxcover. She has the power. So she'll show up late or not at all. 99.9% of them do that.&quot;&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt; Less successful actresses are more likely to perform more extreme acts such as '[[Double anal|double-anal]]'.&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt; If an actress is willing to perform more extreme acts she will receive more offers of work.&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt; Older or less attractive actresses are more likely to perform such acts in order to get work.&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt; According to Morgan, &quot;Some girls are used in nine months or a year. An 18-year-old, sweet young thing, signs with an agency, makes five films in her first week. Five directors, five actors, five times five: she gets phone calls. A hundred movies in four months. She's not a fresh face any more. Her price slips and she stops getting phone calls. Then it's, 'Okay, will you do anal? Will you do [[gangbang]]s?' Then they're used up. They can't even get a phone call. The market forces of this industry use them up.&quot;&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt; 

Some [[film studios]] encourage their actresses to have [[breast implants]], and offer to pay for the procedure.&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt;

While the primary focus of heterosexual sex films are the women in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance, there is a definite focus on the male performers who are able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies. Most male performers in heterosexual pornography are generally selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess, namely their ability to do three things: achieve an [[erection]] while on a busy film set, maintain that erection while performing on camera, and then [[ejaculation|ejaculate]] on cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Jenna|authorlink=Jenna Jameson|coauthors=Neil Strauss|title=How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale|year=2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-053909-7|quote=(Y)ou have to be able to get it up at will.

[[John Holmes (pornographic actor)|John Holmes]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Peter North (porn actor)|Peter North]] and [[Rocco Siffredi]] are probably the most famous male performers in porn films.  Ron Jeremy is known for his large penis and an appearance very unusual for a porn star (he is overweight with large amounts of body hair). Adding to his fame, Ron Jeremy has been a staple in the industry since the 1970s and has become something of a cultural icon; industry magazine ''[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]]'' had him at number one in their &quot;100 Top Porn Stars of All Time&quot; list.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVN Top 50&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.action-dvd.com/avnt50ps.asp?whichpage=1&amp;userid=3AED28DC%2D3047%2D4F5C%2D87F5%2DD9AC3B9DA6F3&amp;sort_order=|title=AVN: The 10 Top Porn Stars of All Time|accessdate=2006-12-24|publisher=Action-DVD.com|month=January | year=2002|work=Adult Video News|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930015019/http://www.action-dvd.com/avnt50ps.asp?whichpage=1&amp;userid=3AED28DC-3047-4F5C-87F5-D9AC3B9DA6F3&amp;sort_order=

==Pay rates==

Most male performers in straight porn are paid less than their female costars. [[Ron Jeremy]] has commented on the pay scale of women and men of the sex film industry: &quot;The average guy gets $300 to $400 a scene, or $100 to $200 if he's new. A woman makes $100,000 to $250,000 at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.askmen.com/toys/interview/34b_ron_jeremy_interview.html Ron Jeremy: Penetrating society since '78]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Girls can easily make 100K-250K per year, plus stuff on the side like strip shows and appearances. The average guy makes $40,000 a year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2/ronj/ Jeremy spoke in class today: An exclusive interview with porn movie legend, Ron Jeremy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some state that gay male porn generally pays men much more than heterosexual porn; a number of male performers, including North, have appeared in both heterosexual and gay pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285455/ 'The Bigger the Better' (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly, men who perform in gay pornography but identify themselves as heterosexual, most notably [[Wolf Hudson]], are said to do [[gay-for-pay]], that is, perform in gay movies only for the paycheck, not because of any personal attraction they have to other men.

According to notable producer [[Seymore Butts]] who runs his own sex film recruitment agency, as well as producing sex films; &quot;depending on draw, female performers who perform in both straight and lesbian porn earn more than those who do normal sex (Boy/Girl) usually make about US$200–800 while those who only do oral sex (blow job) usually only make about US$100–300 for the scene&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.hush-hush.co.uk/pornbus_men.html | title=How to become a porn star and get in the Porn business | accessdate=2007-04-14 | publisher=''hush-hush.co.uk''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noted in an interview conducted by Local10 news of Florida that individuals were offered $700 for sexual intercourse while shooting a scene of the popular series [[Bang Bus]] in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.local10.com/news/3927246/detail.html|title= Porn Bus Shoots Sex On The Move|accessdate= 2008-06-29|date= 2004-11-17|publisher= [[WPLG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Videobox, a porn website, actresses make: Blowjobs: $200–$400, Straight sex: $400–$1,200, Anal sex: $900–$1,500, Double Penetration: $1,200–$1,600, Double anal: $2,000. For more unusual fetishes, women generally get 15% extra.
&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.videobox.com/blog/index.php/2008/02/22/how-much-do-porn-stars-make/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 actress [[Chloe (pornographic actress)|Chloe]] said of pay-rates; &quot;In [[Gonzo pornography|Gonzo]], you're paid not by the picture, but by the scene. So it's girl-girl: $700, plus $100 for an anal toy. Boy-girl: $900. Anal: $1,100. Solo: $500. DP: $1,500.&quot;&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt;

==Pornographic actors and STDs==

Because of the nature of their work, usually involving sex without [[condom]]s, pornographic actors are particularly vulnerable to [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. Data suggest that pornographic actors have a higher rate of STDs (except for HIV) than the general American population. Among 825 performers screened in 2000–2001, 7.7% of females and 5.5% of males had [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], and 2% overall had [[gonorrhea]]. These rates are much higher than in patients visiting family planning clinics, where chlamydia and gonorrhea rates were 4.0% and 0.7%, respectively.... Between January 2003 and March 2005, approximately 976 performers were reported with 1,153 positive STD test results. Of the 1,153 positive test results, 722 (62.6 %) were chlamydia, 355 (30.8%) were gonorrhea, and 126 (10.9%) were coinfections with chlamydia and gonorrhea [10]. Less is known about the prevalence and risk of transmission of other STDs such as [[syphilis]], [[herpes simplex]] virus, [[human papillomavirus]], [[hepatitis B]] or [[hepatitis C|C]], [[Trichomoniasis|trichomonal infection]], or diseases transmitted through the fecal–oral route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1892037|title = The Adult Film Industry: Time to Regulate?|accessdate = 2007-10-01|last = Grudzen|first = Corita R.|coauthors = Kerndt, Peter R.|date = 2007-06-19|work = PLoS Medicine|publisher = [[Public Library of Science]], [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]|archiveurl = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/560898|archivedate = 2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to actress [[Chloe (pornographic actress)|Chloe]], &quot;After you've been in this business for a while, you have herpes. Everyone has herpes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Amis/&gt;

In the 1980s, an outbreak of HIV led to a number of deaths of erotic actors and actresses, including [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]], [[Wade Nichols]], [[Marc Stevens (porn actor)|Marc Stevens]], [[Al Parker]]. This led to the creation of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]], which helped set up a voluntary standard&lt;ref name=PornStarsDefend&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-porn-hiv13-2009jun13,0,4356396.story|title= Porn stars at L.A. convention defend HIV tests|accessdate= 2009-06-13|coauthors= Kimi Yoshino and Rong-Gong Lin II|date= 2009-06-13|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. adult film industry where erotic actors are tested for [[HIV]] every 30 days. All sexual contact is logged, and positive test results lead to all sexual contacts for the last three to six months being contacted and re-tested.  The use of condoms became standard in films featuring homosexual [[anal sex]]. Thanks to accurate and mandatory medical tests HIV cases are nowadays extremely rare in the pornographic industry. Nevertheless, a few cases were reported.

In 1997, [[John Stagliano]] tested positive for [[HIV]]. He contracted the virus recreationally after having unprotected anal sex with a Brazilian transsexual in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,458058,00.html A rough trade | By genre | guardian.co.uk Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a second outbreak occurred. [[Sharon Mitchell]], Director of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]], announced on April 30, that [[Marc Wallice]] was HIV-positive. Wallice's career was effectively over, with rumors and speculation that he also infected several actresses, including [[Brooke Ashley]], [[Tricia Devereaux]], Caroline, Jordan McKnight, Barbara Doll, and Kimberly Jade. He denies the rumors, but they continue to resonate with many in the business; he had been caught with a fake AIDS certificate only months before the scandal broke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adult-pornstar-mall.com/pornlist/malepgs/Marc_Wallice.htm Marc Wallice, Marc Wallice Porn Star DVD Movies and VHS Video Films at www.excaliburfilms.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, another male performer tested HIV positive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/apr/18/usa.aids HIV scare hits US porn industry | World news | The Observer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, a male performer, [[Darren James]], tested positive for HIV;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avn.com/index.cfm?objectId=70F9F731-B1EE-818D-931BEAF17B36C7C6&amp;articleID=ED9EB477-1372-4B41-C447066AE72E0731

These were Canadian newcomer [[Lara Roxx]], [[Miss Arroyo]], and Czech-born [[Jessica Dee]]. Viral load tests showed that James was &quot;[[Patient Zero]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avn.com/index.cfm?objectId=70F9F731-B1EE-818D-931BEAF17B36C7C6&amp;articleID=ED9EC7FF-1372-4B41-C4122FFDC2F9EB95

In June 2009, an unidentified female performer was announced as having tested positive for HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.xbiz.com/news/109218|title= HIV 'Patient Zero' Tested Positive on June 6|accessdate= 2009-06-12|author= Tod Hunter|date= 2009-06-11|publisher= XBiz}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that announcement was made, [[Los Angeles County]] officials announced that there had been 16 previously unpublicized cases of HIV involving adult film performers which had not been publicized since the 2004 Darren James, and that a total of 16 men and 5 women who worked in the adult film industry performers contracted HIV between 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/06/at-least-16-previously-unpublicized-hiv-cases-in-porn-film-performers-public-health-officials-say.html|title= At least 16 previously unpublicized HIV cases in porn film performers, public health officials say|accessdate= 2009-06-12|coauthors= Kimi Yoshino and Rong-Gong Lin II|date= 2009-06-11|publisher= Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; though officials later backtracked by stating that the agency did not know whether any of those people were performers. Sharon Mitchell, co-founder of the clinic that did the testing, has said that these people were either non-performers or aspiring actors who tested positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-porn-hiv17-2009jun17,0,7502132.story|title= L.A.

[[File:Porn hurts.jpg|thumb|right|A sign outside an Adult store.]]
The term '''anti-pornography movement''' is used to describe those who argue that [[pornography]] has a variety of harmful effects, such as encouragement of [[human trafficking]], desensitization, [[pedophilia]], dehumanization, exploitation, [[sexual dysfunction]], and inability to maintain healthy sexual relationships. Many of those involved in the anti-pornography movement come from religious groups, accredited psychologists, [[feminism|feminists]], and individuals who feel that pornography plays a major role in the breakdown of marriages and relationships.

Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again... Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, curtailments, and costs...&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They say sex is reserved for heterosexual married couples, to be used only in accordance with [[God]]'s [[will (philosophy)|will]], and assert that use of pornography involves indulgence in [[lust]] (which in [[Christianity]] is a [[sin]])&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=5&amp;verse=27&amp;end_verse=29&amp;version=31&amp;context=context Matthew 5:27-29 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and leads to an overall increase in sexually immoral behavior.

==Anti-pornography feminist views==
{{Main|Feminist views on pornography}}
[[Radical feminists]] are opposed to pornography, arguing that it is an industry which exploits women and which is complicit in [[violence against women]], both in its production (where, they charge, abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where, they charge, pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]).  At the same time, many feminists differentiate between different sorts of porn.

In the [[United States]], a 1969 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision which held that people could view whatever they wished in the privacy of their own homes&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=394&amp;invol=557 STANLEY v.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Anti-pornography movement in the United Kingdom}}
The most concerted opposition in the [[United Kingdom]] comes from the [[Mediawatch-uk|Mediawatch]] group.  This [[Christian Right]] organisation wishes to criminalise possession of pornography, and founded and formerly led by the late [[Mary Whitehouse]]. It was formerly known as the National Viewers and Listeners Association.

===South African Parliamentary Commission on pornography===

The South African government is reviewing the [http://www.fpb.gov.za/docs_publications/acts_regulations/docs/a34-99.pdf Films and Publications Act], which prohibits both virtual and real [[child pornography]].  Real child pornography involves the use of real children involved in sexual conduct while virtual child pornography is made up of a number of different types of erotic material that do not involve the use of actual children (including paintings, cartoons, sketches, digitally-created images and written descriptions as well as depictions of adults represented as under the age of 18). A recent [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YMDpvJ9xcw submission]to the South Parliament argued that real child pornography ought to be prohibited while virtual child pornography ought not to be prohibited. The [http://www.pmg.org.za/viewminute.php?id=8983 submission process], which involved discussion between members of the public, non-governmental organizations and members of parliament, was recorded by the Parliamentary Monitoring Group.

      <comment>/* Bible */ inserted linkage to [[Lust]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Religious views on pornography''' often discourage congregation members from viewing or reading pornography, and support legislation restricting its publication. These positions derive from broader religious views about sexuality. 

==Role of sex in society==
In many religious traditions, for example, sexual intercourse is limited to the express function of procreation. Thus, sexual pleasure or sex-oriented entertainment, as well as lack of modesty, are considered to be sexual immorality by many.

==Christianity==

===Bible===
{{seealso|Biblical law in Christianity}}

There is no simple direct prohibition of pornographic media in the Bible. Extrapolation and generalization of Matthew 5:27,28 (part of the [[Expounding of the Law]]) is required.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, see [[Lust#Christianity|Biblical Lust]] for a careful [[Koine Greek]] analysis of this frequently quoted verse. Also see the [[Lust#Origin|history of Lust]] for its social origins and etymology.

Also significant is the [[Apostolic Decree]] against ''fornication'':

:&quot;Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the [[Gentiles]] are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from [[idolatry|pollutions of idols]], and from [[fornication]], and from things strangled, and from [[Taboo food#Blood|blood]]. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the [[synagogues]] every [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] day&quot; ({{bibleref|Acts|15:19–21|KJV}}).

===Roman Catholic Church===
Paragraph 2354 of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pornography... offends against [[chastity]] because it perverts the conjugal act, the [[Intimacy|intimate]] giving of spouses to each another. It does grave injury to the [[dignity]] of its participants... since each one becomes an [[Object (philosophy)|object]] of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the [[illusion]] of a [[fantasy]] world. It is a grave offense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many are opposed to pornography because of religious convictions and morals, as exemplified by the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], which states:
:''&quot;Pornography consists in removing real or simulated sexual acts from the intimacy of the partners, in order to display them deliberately to third parties. It offends against chastity because it perverts the conjugal act, the intimate giving of spouses to each other. It does grave injury to the dignity of its participants (actors, vendors, the public), since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. It immerses all who are involved in the illusion of a fantasy world. It is a grave offense. Civil authorities should prevent the production and distribution of pornographic materials.&quot;'' Section 2354&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P85.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
In addition to expressing concerns about sexual immorality, some people take an anti-pornography stance claiming that viewing pornography can be addictive, leading to self-destructive behavior. Proponents of this view compare [[pornography addiction]] to [[alcoholism]], both in asserting the seriousness of the problem and in developing treatment methods.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[Jerry Falwell]] criticized pornography on religious-[[morality|moral]] grounds. They say sex is reserved for heterosexual married couples, to be used only in accordance with [[God]]'s [[will (philosophy)|will]], and assert that use of pornography involves indulgence in [[lust]] (which in [[Christianity]] is a [[sin]])&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&amp;chapter=5&amp;verse=27&amp;end_verse=29&amp;version=31&amp;context=context Matthew 5:27-29 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and leads to an overall increase in sexually immoral behavior.

[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], former president of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] was well known within the faith for expounding his organization's sentiments against pornography.&lt;ref&gt;see &quot;A Tragic Evil Among Us&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Though the [[Torah]] (Jewish written law) has a great many prohibitions regarding sexual behaviors, pornography is not specifically mentioned. However, traditional Jewish laws of modesty (''[[tzniut]]'') require Jewish women to be modestly dressed (thereby forbidding pornographic modeling or pornographic acting for women). The ''[[halakhah]]'' states that sexually arousing images are to be avoided. &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tznius Tzniut] - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The Qur'an 24:31 states &quot;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and keep covered their private parts, and that they should not show-off their beauty except what is apparent, and let them cast their shawls over their cleavage. And let them not show off their beauty except to their husbands... &quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Quran/24?oldid=506079&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
''Sikhs argue that pornographic books and films, prostitution and lust leading to adultery''&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hnICyg09IEIC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=sikhism+and+pornography&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hg6uruvmdv&amp;sig=bhQWI7pM2DpsY4W2cJ4wLRvtOgE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k-pISufHDp6QjAeDrtBi&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&lt;/ref&gt;. Pornography in Sikhism is said to encourage, Lust (Kaam),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikhwomen.com/Guru_Quotes/Guru_on_sexuality_lust.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which is a concept described as an unhealthy obsession for sex and sexual activity. Kaam is heavily discouraged for Sikhs, as this &quot;''can build barriers against God in their lives''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantrism==
Some other religions do not find sexual pleasure immoral, but see sex as a sacred, godly, highly-pleasurable activity. These traditions do not condemn sexual pleasure in and of itself, but they impose limitations on the circumstances under which sexual pleasure should be properly experienced. Pornography in this view is seen as the secularization of something sacred, and so, a violation of spouses' intimate relationship.

'''Feminist views on pornography''' range from condemnation of it as a form of [[violence against women]] to embrace of at least some forms as a medium of feminist expression, to a range of views between. Feminist debate on this issue reflects larger divisions around [[feminist views on sexuality]], and are closely related to [[feminist views on prostitution|feminist debates on prostitution]], [[BDSM]], and other issues. Pornography and related issues have been some of the most divisive issues in [[feminism]], particularly among feminists in anglophone countries. This deep division between feminists was exemplified in the [[Feminist Sex Wars]] of the 1980s, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism.

==Anti-pornography feminism==
Radical feminist opponents of pornography—such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Diana Russell]], [[Alice Schwarzer]], and [[Robert Jensen]]—argue that pornography is harmful to women, and constitutes strong causality or facilitation of violence against women. 

===Harm to women during production===
Anti-pornography feminists, notably Catherine MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic [[coercion]] of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name=stanford-shrage&gt;Shrage, Laurie. (2007-07-13). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-sex-markets/#Por &quot;Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets: Pornography&quot;]. In: ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Catherine A. (1984) &quot;Not a moral issue.&quot; ''Yale Law and Policy Review'' 2:321-345. Reprinted in: Mackinnon (1989). ''Toward a Feminist Theory of the State'' Harvard University Press. ISBN 0674896459 (1st ed), ISBN 0674896467 (2nd ed). &quot;Sex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be forced on other real women; women's bodies trussed and maimed and raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed, and this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is visible and the coercion that has become invisible—this and more grounds the feminist concern with pornography&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode| title = A Conversation With Catherine MacKinnon (transcript)| series = [[Think Tank]]|network= PBS| accessdate = 2009-09-01| date = 1995| url = http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. [[Gail Dines]] holds that pornography, exemplified by [[gonzo pornography]], is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail. (2007-03-24). &quot;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5003155114018800220# Pornography &amp; Pop Culture: Putting the Text in Context]&quot; Presentation at: ''Pornography &amp; Pop Culture - Rethinking Theory, Reframing Activism''. Wheelock College, Boston, March 24, 2007. Archived at [[Google Video]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Dines| first = Gail.| title = Penn, Porn and Me| work = [[CounterPunch]]| accessdate = 2009-09-06| date = 2008-06-23| url = http://www.counterpunch.org/dines06232008.html}} &quot;The porn that makes most of the money for the industry is actually the gonzo, body-punishing variety that shows women’s bodies being physically stretched to the limit, humiliated and degraded. Even porn industry people commented in a recent article in Adult Video News, that gonzo porn is taking its toll on the women, and the turnover is high because they can’t stand the brutal acts on the body for very long.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-pornography feminists point to the testimony of well known participants in pornography, such as [[Traci Lords]] and [[Linda Boreman]], and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography, either by somebody else, or by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of ''Ordeal'', in which Linda Boreman (who under the name of &quot;Linda Lovelace&quot; had starred in ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') stated that she had been beaten, raped, and [[pimp]]ed by her husband [[Chuck Traynor]], and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in ''Deep Throat'', as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence, to make other pornographic films. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches.

===Social harm from consumption===
====Women reduced to sex objects====
Anti-pornography feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to [[sexism]], arguing that in pornographic performances, the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men's pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and the women are showed in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner.

====Enticement to sexual violence against women====
Anti-pornography feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of [[rape]] and other forms of [[violence against women]]. Robin Morgan summarizes this idea with her often-quoted statement, &quot;Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Robin. (1974). &quot;Theory and Practice: Pornography and Rape&quot;. In: ''Going Too Far: The Personal Chronicle of a Feminist''. (1977). Random House. 333 p. ISBN 0394482271. (1978 ed, ISBN 039472612X.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-pornography feminists charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]. MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering [[rape myths]]. Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no. Additionally, according to MacKinnon, pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women, and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused, an effect she claims is well-documented.&lt;ref name=mackinnon-guardian&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jeffries| first = Stuart.| title = Are women human? (interview with Catharine MacKinnon)|work = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 2009-09-01| date = 2006-04-12| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Distorted view of the human body and sexuality====
[[Germany|German]] radical feminist [[Alice Schwarzer]] is one proponent of this point of view, in particular in the feminist magazine ''Emma''. Many opponents of pornography believe that pornography gives a distorted view of men and women's bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing the performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure.

===Anti-pornography feminist organizations and campaigns===
Beginning in the late 1970s, anti-pornography [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] formed organizations such as [[Women Against Pornography]], [[Women Against Violence and Pornography in Media]], [[Women Against Violence Against Women]], and like groups that provided educational events, including slide-shows, speeches, and guided tours of the sex shops in areas like New York's [[Times Square]] and San Francisco's [[Tenderloin District]], in order to raise awareness of the content of pornography and the sexual subculture in pornography shops and live sex shows.

Similar groups also emerged in the United Kingdom, including legislatively focused groups such as [[Campaign Against Pornography]] and [[Campaign Against Pornography and Censorship]], as well as groups associated with [[Revolutionary Feminism]] such as Women Against Violence Against Women and its [[direct action]] offshoot [[Angry Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Angry Wimmin| series = Lefties|network= BBC Four| accessdate = 2009-09-01| url =}} ([http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/lefties2.shtml Abstract].)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-pornography feminists, such as [[Nikki Craft]], [[Ann Simonton]], and [[Melissa Farley]], have advocated and carried out [[civil disobedience]] and [[direct action]] against pornography and been arrested for public nudity. They campaign against corporations through destruction of single copies of magazines that contained violent pornography that they argue condones and legitimises rape as sexual entertainment. They advocate rejecting the representations of sexual objectification as exemplified in publications like ''[[Hustler]]'' and ''[[Penthouse]]''.

===Legislative efforts===
====Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance====
Many anti-pornography feminists—Dworkin and MacKinnon in particular—advocated laws which defined pornography as harm and allowed women to sue pornographers in [[civil law (common law)|civil court]]. The [[Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance]] that they drafted was passed twice by the [[Minneapolis]] city council in 1983, but vetoed by Mayor Donald Fraser, on the grounds that the city could not afford the litigation over the law's [[constitutionality]]. 

The ordinance was successfully passed in 1984 by the [[Indianapolis]] city council and signed by Mayor [[William Hudnut]], and passed by a [[ballot initiative]] in [[Bellingham, Washington]] in 1988, but struck down both times as unconstitutional by the state and federal courts. In 1986, the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] affirmed the lower courts' rulings in the [[Indianapolis]] case without comment.

Many anti-pornography feminists supported the legislative efforts, but others objected that legislative campaigns would be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of [[free speech]], or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and [[direct action]] and entangling it in political squabbles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Brownmiller|Brownmiller, Susan]] (1999). ''In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution''. New York: The Dial Press. p 298-299. ISBN 0-385-31486-8. p 318–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

====R. v. Butler====
The [[Supreme Court of Canada]]'s 1992 ruling in ''[[R. v. Butler]]'' (the Butler decision) fueled further controversy, when the court decided to incorporate some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian [[obscenity]] law. In ''Butler'' the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law ''could'' be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. 

The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the [[Women's Legal Education and Action Fund]] (LEAF), with MacKinnon's support and participation.

{{Cleanup-rewrite|it is an incomplete, somewhat inaccurate, and almost entirely unreferenced summary of sex-positive views|section|date=September 2009}}

===Sex-positive feminism===
[[Sex-positive feminism]] (also known as &quot;pro-sex feminism&quot;) emphasizes the need for [[sexual liberation]] and [[sexual freedom]] as a key component of [[women's liberation]]. Pornography is seen as being at least potentially a medium for women's sexual expression in this view. Sex-positive feminists view many [[radical feminist]] views on sexuality, including views on pornography, as being as oppressive as those of [[patriarchal]] religions and ideologies, and argue that anti-pornography feminist discourse ignores and trivializes women's sexual agency. [[Ellen Willis]] (who coined the term &quot;pro-sex feminism&quot;) states &quot;As we saw it, the claim that 'pornography is violence against women' was code for the neo-Victorian idea that men want sex and women endure it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| edition = 50th Anniversary special edition| last = Willis| first = Ellen.| title = Lust Horizons: The 'Voice' and the women's movement| work = [[Village Voice]]| accessdate = 2009-09-02| date = 2005-10-18| url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-10-18/specials/lust-horizons/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-positive feminists take a variety of views towards existing pornography. Most view existing pornography as sexist and almost exclusive focused on the desires of heterosexual men. Nevertheless, many sex-positive feminists see even existing pornography as subverting many traditional ideas about women that they oppose, such as ideas that women do not like sex generally, only enjoy sex in a relational context, or that women only enjoy [[vanilla sex]]. Pornography often shows women in sexually dominant roles and presents women with a greater variety of body types than are typical of mainstream entertainment and fashion. Others view existing heterosexual male-oriented pornography as [[misogynist]] and rife with exploitation, but hold that feminist-produced and women-centered pornography is possible, and proposes to reform or radically alter the pornography industry.

===Feminist critique of censorship===
Many feminists regardless of their views on pornography are opposed on principal to censorship. Even many feminists who see pornography as a sexist institution, also see censorship (including MacKinnon's civil law approach) as a far greater evil than pornography. In its mission statement, [[Feminists for Free Expression]] argues that censorship has never reduced violence, but historically been used to silence women and stifle efforts for social change. They point to the birth control literature of [[Margaret Sanger]], the feminist plays of [[Holly Hughes]], and works like ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'' and ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' as examples of feminist sexual speech which has been the target of censorship. FFE further argues that the attempt to fix social problems through censorship, &quot;divert[s] attention from the substantive causes of social ills and offer a cosmetic, dangerous 'quick fix.'&quot; They argue that instead a free and vigorous [[marketplace of ideas]] is the best assurance for achieving feminist goals in a democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Feminists For Free Expression: Mission| accessdate = 2009-09-02| url = http://www.ffeusa.org/html/mission/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of anti-pornography feminism accuse their counterparts of selective handling of social scientific evidence. Anti-pornography feminists are also critiqued as intolerant of sexual difference and is characterized as often indiscriminately supporting state [[censorship]] policy and are accused of complicity with [[conservative]] sexual politics and [[Christian Right]] groups.

Several feminist anti-censorship groups have actively opposed anti-pornography legislation and other forms of censorship. These groups have included the [[Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce]] (FACT) and Feminists for Free Expression in the US and [[Feminists Against Censorship]] in the UK.

Feminists opposed to anti-pornography legislation argue that even when such legislation is feminist-inspired, it can potentially be used to target the speech of women and sexual minorities. They argue that this was exemplified by the first two anti-obscenity actions by the Canadian government following ''[[R. v. Butler]]''. The first of these was the raid and [[R. v. Glad Day Bookshops Inc.|prosecution of Glad Day Bookshop]], an [[LGBT]] bookstore in [[Ontario]], for selling copies of the lesbian [[BDSM]] magazine ''Bad Attitude''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The second was the seizure at the Canadian border of books destined for the Vancouver, BC lesbian bookstore, Little Sisters (see [[Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon responded with a statement claiming that the idea that these raids reflected the application of pre-''Butler'' standards and that it was actually illegal under ''Butler'' to selectively target LGBT materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = MacKinnon| first = Catharine A.| coauthors = Andrea Dworkin.| title = Statement Regarding Canadian Customs and Legal Approaches to Pornography| accessdate = 2009-09-01| date = 1994-08-26| url = http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/OrdinanceCanada.html}} (Archived at ''Andrea Dworkin Web Site''.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of ''Butler'' have countered that the decision simply reinforced an existing politics of censorship that pre-dated the decision.&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Scribner| isbn = 0814781497| pages = 242–244| last = Strossen| first = Nadine| title = Defending pornography: free speech, sex, and the fight for women's rights| date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Toronto Press| isbn = 0802076432| pages = 48–106 (p 100)| last = Gotell| first = Lise| title = Bad Attitude/s on Trial: Pornography, Feminism, and the Butler Decision|editor = Brenda Cossman| chapter = Shaping ''Butler'': the new politics of anti-pornography| date = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-censorship feminists question why only some forms of sexist communication (namely sexually arousing/explicit ones) should be banned, while not advocating bans against equally misogynist public discourse. [[Susie Bright]] notes, &quot;It's a far different criticism to note that porn is sexist.  So are all commercial media.  That's like tasting several glasses of salt water and insisting only one of them is salty.  The difference with porn is that it is people fucking, and we live in a world that cannot tolerate that image in public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Bright| first = Susie.| title = The Prime of Miss Kitty MacKinnon| work = [[East Bay Express]]| accessdate = 2009-09-02| date = 1993-10| url = http://susiebright.blogs.com/Old_Static_Site_Files/Prime_Of_Kitty_MacKinnon.pdf}} (Republished, 1995 in: ''Sexwise'', p 121–127, ISBN 1-57344-002-7. Archived at SusieBright.blogspot.com.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of pornographic actresses===
Some pornographic actresses such as [[Nina Hartley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cleis Press| isbn = 1-57344-042-6| pages = 142–144| last = Hartley| first = Nina.| title = Sex Work: Writings by Women in the Sex Industry|editor = Frédérique Delacoste &amp;  Priscilla Alexander| chapter = Confessions of a feminist porno star| date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovidie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = La Musardine| isbn = 2842712374| last = Ovidie.| title = Porno Manifesto| date = 2004}} (In French).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sasha Grey]] are also self-described sex-positive feminists, and state that they do not see themselves as victims of sexism. They defend their decision to perform in pornography as freely chosen, and argue that much of what they do on camera is an expression of their sexuality. It has also been pointed out that in pornography, women generally earn more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Faludi|Faludi, Susan]]. (2000). ''Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man''. Perennial. ISBN 0-380-72045-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Some porn performers such as Nina Hartley are active in the [[sex workers' rights]] movement.

===Feminist pornography===
Pornography produced by sex-positive feminist women is a small but growing segment of the porn industry. Feminist porn directors include [[Candida Royalle]], [[Tristan Taormino]], [[Shine Louise Houston]], and  [[Erika Lust]]. Some of these directors make pornography specifically for a female or [[genderqueer]] audience, while others try for a broad appeal across genders and sexual orientations. 

According to Tristan Taormino, &quot;[[Sex-positive feminism|Feminist porn]] both responds to dominant images with alternative ones and creates its own iconography.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Taormino| first = Tristan.| title = Political Smut Makers| work = [[Village Voice]]| accessdate = 2009-09-01| date = 2006-06-06| url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-06-06/columns/political-smut-makers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, there has been a [[Feminist Porn Awards]] held annually in Toronto, sponsored by a local feminist [[sex toy]] business, Good for Her. The awards are given in a number of categories and have three guiding criteria: &quot;1) A woman had a hand in the production, writing, direction, etc. of the work. 2) It depicts genuine female pleasure. 3) It expands the boundaries of sexual representation on film and challenges stereotypes that are often found in mainstream porn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Feminist Porn Awards| work = Good for Her ''(website)''| accessdate = 2009-09-07| url = http://goodforher.com/Feminist_Porn_Awards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Walker| first = Susan.| title = Women behind the camera for new breed of adult film| work = [[Toronto Star]]| accessdate = 2009-09-07| date = 2009-04-04| url = http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/410064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Vogels| first = Josey.| title = Female-friendly porn| work = Metro| accessdate = 2009-09-07| date = 2009-04-21| url = http://www.metronews.ca/toronto/comment/article/216343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific issues==
===Pornography and erotica===
Some anti-pornography feminists, such as [[Gloria Steinem]], distinguish between &quot;pornography&quot; and &quot;erotica&quot;, as different classes of sexual media, the former emphasizing dominance and the later emphasizing mutuality. Steinem holds that, &quot;These two sorts of images are as different as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.&quot; Feminists who subscribe to this view hold that erotica promotes positive and pro-woman sexual values and does not carry the harmful effects of pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Steinem, Gloria. 1983. &quot;Erotica vs Pornography&quot;. In: ''Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions''. New American Library. ISBN 0451155009 (1983 ed). ISBN 0805042024 (2nd ed).&lt;/ref&gt; Such feminists hold that erotica should not be subject to the same legislative opposition as pornography.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Other anti-pornography feminists are more skeptical about this distinction, holding that all sexual materials produced in a patriarchal system are expressions of male dominance.&lt;ref&gt;LeMoncheck, Linda. (1997). ''Loose women, lecherous men: a feminist philosophy of sex''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0195105567. p 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Dworkin wrote, &quot;erotica is simply high-class pornography: better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea. (1979). ''Pornography, Men Possessing Women''. Perigee Books. ISBN 0-399-50532-6. p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex-positive feminists tend not to make a distinction between pornography and erotica, and those that have addressed the distinction made by Steinem and others find it problematic. [[Ellen Willis]] holds that the term 'erotica' is needlessly vague and euphemistic, and appeals to an idealized version of what kind of sex people should want rather than what arouses the sexual feelings people actually have. She also emphasizes the subjectivity of the distinction, stating, &quot;In practice, attempts to sort out good erotica from bad porn inevitably comes down to 'What turns me on is erotica; what turns you on is pornographic.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Ellen. (1979). &quot;Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography&quot;. In ''Beginning to See the Light: Pieces of a Decade''. New York: Knopf : distributed by Random House. ISBN 0-394-51137-9, (1st ed); ISBN 0819562556, (2nd ed). &lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminists make an analogous distinction between mainstream pornography and feminist pornography, viewing mainstream pornography as problematic or even wholly misogynistic while praising feminist pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Columbia University Press| isbn = 0231-10708-0| last = McIntosh, Mary.| title = Feminism and Sexuality: A Reader|editor= Stevi Jackson and Sue Scott| chapter = Liberalism and the contradictions of oppression| pages = 333–341

'''Internet pornography''' is [[pornography]] that is distributed by means of various sectors of the [[Internet]],  primarily via [[website]]s, [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]], or [[Usenet]] newsgroups. While  pornography had been traded over the Internet since the 1980s, it was the invention of the  [[World Wide Web]] in 1991 as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time that led to an explosion in online pornography.

Like [[videotape]]s and [[DVD]]s, the Internet has proved popular for distributing pornography  because it allows people to view pornography (essentially) anonymously in the comfort and  privacy of their homes. It also allows access to pornography by people whose access is  otherwise restricted for legal or social reasons.

==History and methods of distribution==
While pornography had seen limited distribution over the Internet in the early 90's, often as [[ASCII porn]], it was not  until the Internet became more accessible to the general public that Internet pornography became a widespread phenomenon. Online distribution of pornography then often consisted of Internet users uploading scanned photos from [[adult magazine]]s to [[Usenet newsgroup]]s. This type of distribution was generally free (apart from fees for Internet  access), and provided a great deal of anonymity. The anonymity made it safe and easy to ignore  [[copyright]] restrictions, as well as protecting the identity of uploaders and downloaders.  Around this time frame, pornography was also distributed via pornographic [[Bulletin Board System]]s such as [[Rusty n Edie's BBS|Rusty n Edie's]]. These BBSes could charge users for access, leading to the first  commercial online pornography (though not &quot;Internet pornography,&quot; since BBSes were not accessed via the Internet).

The invention of the [[World Wide Web]] spurred both commercial and non-commercial  distribution of pornography. The rise of pornography websites offering photos, video clips and [[streaming media]] including live [[webcam]] access allowed greater access to pornography.

===Free vs. commercial===
On the Web, there are both commercial and free pornography sites. The bandwidth usage of a pornography site is relatively high, and the income a free site can earn through  advertising may not be sufficient to cover the costs of that bandwidth. One recent entry into the free pornography website market are [[Thumbnail gallery post]] sites. These are free websites that post links to commercial sites, providing a sampling of the commercial site in the form of [[thumbnail]] images, or in the form of [[Free Hosted Galleries]]—samplings of full-sized content provided and hosted by the commercial sites to promote their site.  Some free websites primarily serve as [[web portal|portal]]s by keeping up-to-date indexes of these smaller sampler sites. These intents to create directories about adult content and websites were followed by the creation of adult wikis where the user can contribute his knowledge and recommend quality resources and links. &lt;ref&gt;http://pornopedia.org&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an adult wiki that is using the MediaWiki Software is [[Pornopedia]]. When a user purchases a subscription to a commercial site after clicking through from a free thumbnail gallery site, the commercial site makes a payment to the owner of the free site. There are several forms of sites delivering adult content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pornjade.com/articles/1.html | title=Article 'Adult on Web' – Jun. 5, 2007 | accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====TGP====
The most common form of adult content is a categorized list (more often it's a table) of small pictures (called &quot;thumbnails&quot;) linked to galleries. These sites are called a [[Thumbnail gallery post]] (TGP). As a rule, these sites sort thumbs by category and type of content available on a linked gallery. Sites containing thumbs that lead to galleries with video content are called MGP (Movie Gallery Post). The main benefit of TGP/MGP is that the surfer can get a first impression of the content provided by a gallery without actually visiting it. The most abusive form of TGP is the so-called CJ (abbreviation for circlejerk), that contains links that mislead the surfer to sites he or she actually didn't wish to see.  This is also called a redirect.

====Linklists====
Linklists unlike TGP/MGP sites do not list a huge amount of pictures. A linklist is a (frequently) categorised web list of links to so called &quot;freesites*&quot;, but unlike TGP links are provided in a form of text, not thumbs. It's still a question which form is more descriptive to a surfer, but many webmasters trends that thumb for is more productive, and simplifies searching. On the other hand, LinkLists have large amount of unique text, so that helps them to improve their positions in search engine listings. TopLists are linklists whose internal ranking of freesites is based on incoming traffic from that freesites. Except that, freesites designed for TopLists have much more galleries.

====Usenet====
Another free source of pornography on the Internet are the [[Usenet]] newsgroups that were the  first home to such material. Newsgroups tend to be poorly organized and flooded with content  that is [[On-topic|off-topic]] or [[Spam (electronic)|spam]]. Commercial software and websites  are available that allow browsing the images or videos on newsgroups, sometimes with galleries  of thumbnail images.

====Peer-to-peer====
[[Peer-to-peer]] file sharing networks provide another form of free access to pornography.  While such networks have been associated largely with the illegal sharing of copyrighted music and movies, the sharing of pornography has also been a popular use for file sharing. Many commercial sites have recognized this trend and have begun distributing free samples of their content on peer-to-peer networks.

==Internet pornography formats==
===Image files===
Image files, particularly of the [[JPEG]] format, are one of the most common formats for  distributing pornography. Images may be either scanned into the computer from photographs or magazines, produced with a digital camera, or a [[Video frame|frame]] from a video.

===Video files and streaming video===
Video files formats such as [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]], [[Windows Media Video|WMV]],  and [[QuickTime#QuickTime file format|QuickTime]] have been used to distribute pornographic video clips. More recently [[Video CD|VCD]] and [[DVD]] image files allow distribution of whole VCDs and DVDs. Many commercial porn sites exist that allow one to view pornographic streaming video. Recently (mid-2006),  some Internet pornography sites have begun offering [[High Definition Video]] content in [[WMV HD]] format.

Since mid-2006, advertising-supported free pornographic [[video hosting service]] websites based on the [[YouTube]] concept have appeared. Referred to as [[Porn 2.0]], these sites generally use [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] technology to distribute videos that were uploaded by users; these include [[user-generated content]] as well as scenes from commercial porn movies and advertising clips from pornographic websites.

===Webcams===
Another format of adult content that emerged with the advent of the Internet is live [[webcams]]. Webcam content can generally be divided into two categories: group shows offered to members of an adult paysite, and 1-on-1 private sessions usually sold on a pay-per-view basis. Currently the most popular video format for streaming live webcams is Flash Video [[FLV]].

Server-based webcam sex shows spur unique international economics: adult models in various countries perform live webcam shows and chat for clients in affluent countries. This kind of activity is sometimes mediated by companies which will set up websites, manage finances and maintain &quot;office&quot; space for the models to perform from. At times, such companies will exploit the models&amp;nbsp;— making them work long shifts, and paying them only a small fraction of the money they collect from clients.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Other formats===
Other formats include text and audio files. While pornographic and erotic  stories,  distributed as [[text file]]s, web pages, and via message boards and newsgroups, have been  semi-popular, audio porn, via formats like [[MP3]] and [[FLV]],  have seen only very limited  distribution. Audio porn can include recordings of people having sex or reading erotic  stories. Pornographic magazines are available in [[Zinio]] format, which provides a reader program to enable access.

Combination formats, such as [[webtease]]s that consist of images and text have also emerged.

==Legal status==

{{Main article|Legal status of Internet pornography}}

The Internet is an international network and there are currently no international laws  regulating pornography, each country deals with Internet pornography differently. Generally, in the United States, if the act depicted in the pornographic content is legal in the jurisdiction that it is being distributed ''from''  then the distributor of such content would not be in violation of the law regardless of  whether it is accessible in countries where it is illegal. This does not apply to those who  ''access'' the pornography, however, as they could still be prosecuted under local laws in  their country. Due to enforcement problems in anti-pornography laws over the Internet,  countries that prohibit or heavily restrict access to pornography have taken other approaches  to limit access by their citizens, such as employing content filters.

Many activists and politicians have expressed concern over the easy availability of Internet  pornography, especially to minors. This has led to a variety of attempts to restrict  children's access to Internet pornography such as the 1996 [[Communications Decency Act]] in  the United States. Some companies use an [[Adult Verification System]] (AVS) to deny access to  pornography by minors.  However, most Adult Verification Systems charge fees that are substantially higher than the actual costs of any verification they do (for example, in excess of $10/month) and are really part of a revenue collection scheme where sites encourage users to sign up for an AVS system, and get a percentage of the proceeds in return.

In response to concerns with regard to children accessing age-inappropriate content, the adult industry, through the [[Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP)]], began a [[Content-control software#Content Labeling|self-labeling]] initiative called the Restricted to Adults label (RTA). This label is recognized by many web filtering products and is entirely free to use.

Most employers have distinct policies against the accessing of any kind of online pornographic material from company computers,{{citation needed|date=December 2007}} in addition to which some have also installed comprehensive filters and logging software in their local [[computer network]]s.

One area of Internet pornography that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is [[child pornography]]. Because of this, most Internet pornography websites based in the U.S. have a notice on their front page that they comply with [[18 USC Section 2257]], which requires the keeping of records regarding the age of the people depicted in  photographs, along with displaying the Name of the company record keeper. Some site operators outside the U.S. have begun to include this compliance statement on their websites as well.

On April 8, 2008 [[Evil Angel]] and its owner [[John Stagliano]] were charged in federal court with multiple counts of obscenity.  One count was for, &quot;using an interactive computer service to display an obscene movie trailer in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xbiz.com/news/92236 John Stagliano, Evil Angel Charged With 7 Obscenity Violations – XBIZ.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Web filters and blocking software==
A variety of [[content-control software]] is available to block pornography and other classifications of material from particular computers or (usually company-owned) networks. Commercially available Web filters include [[Bess (content-control software)|Bess]], Net Nanny,&lt;!--don't wikilink &quot;Net Nanny&quot;; it currently just redirects to &quot;Content-control software&quot;--&gt; SeeNoEvil, and others. Various work-arounds and bypasses are available for some of these products; [[Peacefire]] is one of the more notable clearinghouses for such countermeasures.

==Internet porn viewing during working hours==
As of October 2008, about one quarter of employees visit Internet porn sites during working hours according to [[Nielsen Online]]. This figure is up by 23% from October 2007. M. J. McMahon, publisher of [[AVN|AVN Online Magazine]] reports that hits are highest during office hours than at any other time of day.&lt;ref name=OnTheJob&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/171279 The Tangled Web of Porn In the Office Newsweek December 8, 2008 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child pornography==
{{main|Child pornography}}

The Internet has radically changed how [[child pornography]] is reproduced and disseminated, and, according to the [[United States Department of Justice]], resulted in a massive increase in the &quot;availability, accessibility, and volume of child pornography.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/ceos/childporn.html ''Child Pornography''], Child Exploitation and Obscenity, Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; The production of child pornography has become very profitable, bringing in several billion dollars a year, and is no longer limited to pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_02-19-2006/Andrew_Vachss ''Child pornography has expanded into a business so profitable it is no longer limited to pedophiles. Let's Fight This Terrible Crime Against Our Children'', Parade, Andrew Vach, February 19, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Jenkins]] notes that there is &quot;overwhelming evidence that [child pornography] is all but impossible to obtain through nonelectronic means.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip (2005). &quot;Law Enforcement Efforts Against Child Pornography Are Ineffective,&quot; in ''At Issue: Child Sexual Abuse''. Ed. Angela Lewis. San Diego: Greenhaven Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NCMEC]] estimated in 2003 that 20% of all pornography traded over the Internet was child pornography, and that since 1997 the number of child pornography images available on the Internet had increased by 1500%.&lt;ref name=ncmec&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=2064 |title=CHILD PORN AMONG FASTEST GROWING INTERNET BUSINESSES |date=2005-08-05 |accessdate=2008-03-13 |publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding internet proliferation, the US DOJ states that &quot;At any one time there are estimated to be more than one million pornographic images of children on the Internet, with 200 new images posted daily.&quot; They also note that a single offender arrested in the U.K. possessed 450,000 child pornography images, and that a single child pornography site received a million hits in a month. Further, that much of the trade in child pornography takes place at hidden levels of the Internet, and that it has been estimated that there are between 50,000 and 100,000 pedophiles involved in organized pornography rings around the world, and that one third of these operate from the United States. Digital cameras and Internet distribution facilitated by the use of credit cards and the ease of transferring images across national borders has made it easier than ever before for users of child pornography to obtain the photographs and videos.&lt;ref name=ncmec/&gt;&lt;ref name=doj1&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Wells, M.; Finkelhor, D.;  Wolak, J.; Mitchell, K. | year = 2007  | title = Defining Child Pornography: Law Enforcement Dilemmas in Investigations of Internet Child Pornography Possession  | journal = Police Practice and Research  | volume = 8  | issue = 3  | pages = 269–282 | url =http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/pdf/CV96.pdf  |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-07-01 |doi=10.1080/15614260701450765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the British-based [[Internet Watch Foundation]] reported that child pornography on the Internet is becoming more brutal and graphic, and the number of images depicting violent abuse has risen fourfold since 2003. The CEO stated &quot;The worrying issue is the severity and the gravity of the images is increasing. We're talking about prepubescent children being raped.&quot; About 80 percent of the children in the abusive images are female, and 91 percent appear to be children under the age of 12. Prosecution is difficult because multiple international servers are used, sometimes to transmit the images in fragments to evade the law.&lt;ref name=IWF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/04/16/international/i170148D42.DTL |title=Watchdog: Online Child Porn More Brutal |accessdate=2008-06-30 |author=Zheng, Yuking |work=AP |date=2007-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnicity''' plays a prominent role in '''pornography'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=12069&amp;115&amp;115&amp;1&amp;p=79]&lt;/ref&gt;
Distinct genres of [[pornography]] focus on [[pornographic actor|performers]] of specific [[ethnic groups]], or on the depiction of [[miscegenation|interracial sexual activity]].  Ethnic pornography typically employs [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic and racial stereotypes]] in its depiction of performers.&lt;ref name=&quot;LukeFord1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lukeisback.com/essays/essays/racism.htm |title=Racism |accessdate=2008-01-18 |author=[[Luke Ford]] |date=1999 |publisher=LukeIsBack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic pornography==
Ethnic pornography intended for a general audience typically features members of significant minority ethnic groups, particularly those seen as [[exoticism|exotic]]. Such people may be seen as sexually unattainable and therefore mysterious and exciting, or as promiscuous or sexually biddable. A viewer may be curious about what people of different ethnic groups look like with their clothes off, or in the visual contrast between people of different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]. Ethnic pornography may provide extra titillation by breaking [[taboo]]s regarding socially unacceptable ethnic or racial stereotypes, [[miscegenation|interracial sex]], or old [[anti-miscegenation laws]].

==Portrayal in pornography==

Ethnic pornography frequently depicts characters based on ethnic and racial stereotypes.  Members of each race are typically portrayed as having a high [[sex drive]]. Racial jokes relating to interracial married couples are also popular.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

; [[Asian people|Asian]] women: Frequently portrayed as sexually submissive. Western film and [[Western literature|literature]] has promoted stereotypes of Asian women, often depicting Asian women as cunning and seductive &quot;[[Dragon Lady (stereotype)|Dragon Ladies]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tong |first=Benson |title=Unsubmissive Women: Chinese Prostitutes in Nineteenth-Century San Francisco |year=1994 |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |location=Norman, Okla. |isbn=0806126531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as servile &quot;Lotus Blossom Babies&quot;, &quot;Innocent School Girls&quot; in private school uniforms, &quot;[[Stereotypes_of_East_and_Southeast_Asians_in_the_United_States#The_.22China_Doll.22_stereotype|China dolls]]&quot;, &quot;[[Geisha|Geisha girls]]&quot;, [[war brides]], or prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tajima |first=R. |editor=Asian Women United of California |title=Making waves: An anthology of writings by and about Asian American women |date=1989-06-28 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=Boston |isbn= 0807059056|pages=308–17 |chapter=Lotus Blossoms Don't Bleed: Images of Asian Women }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese media]] have also at times sensationalistically promoted the stereotype of Japanese women overseas as &quot;[[yellow cab (stereotype)|yellow cabs]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ma |first=Karen |title=The Modern Madame Butterfly: Fantasy and Reality in Japanese Cross-Cultural Relationships |year=1996 |publisher=[[Tuttle Publishing]] |location=North Clarendon, Vt. |isbn=0804820414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Black people|Black]] performers: Large penis size in Black men is consistently emphasized in pornography. Black women are often portrayed with large buttocks, or '[[booty]]'.

; [[Latino|Latinos]] and [[Hispanic]]s: Pornography tends to stereotype Hispanic women as feisty, &quot;hot and spicy Latinas&quot;, sexy [[Señorita]]s, with a high [[sex drive]] and low impulse control. Many are portrayed as [[maid]]s, [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] to the United States, or unfaithful wives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muchacreative.com/Journalism/Latina%20beauty.html The Challenges of 'Cha Cha': Latin/Hispanic stereotypes]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Latinos and Hispanics can be of any race (many are [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|white Hispanic Americans]], [[Mestizo]]s etc.), cultural characteristics are sometimes portrayed via iconic items like Hispanic [[National costume|national costumes]],  [[sombreros]], [[maracas]], or [[Flamenco]] dresses.

==Interracial pornography==

In the past, some of American pornography's leading white actresses were allegedly warned to avoid African-Americans, both on-screen and in their personal lives. One rationale was the purportedly widespread belief that appearing in interracial pornography would ruin a white performer's career, although some observers have said that there is no evidence that this is true.&lt;ref name=&quot;LukeFord1999&quot;/&gt; ''[[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]]'' critic Sheldon Ranz wrote in 1997 that &quot;we keep hearing a lot about 'the powers that be' that tell white women that it's not in their 'interest' to work with blacks. Is there any proof that [[Ginger Lynn|Ginger [Lynn]]]'s scene with Tony El-Lay in ''Undressed Rehearsal'' hurt her career? [[Nina Hartley]] still gets lots of bookings in [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[strip club]]s, especially [[Texas]], even though she is an avowed interracialist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Stars Who Refuse Interracial Scenes |first=Sheldon|last=Ranz |date=1997-04-05 |newsgroup=rec.arts.movies.erotica |url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.movies.erotica/msg/62a4233ee98f905a |accessdate= 2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, interracial films, which most commonly refers to black male/white female films, have increased in popularity, becoming one of the fastest-growing and biggest-selling genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sextelevision.net/archives/episodeArchivesDisplay.asp?episodeID=179&amp;segmentID=472&amp;seasonID=8 |title=Black/White: Sex, Race &amp; Profit |accessdate=2007-07-19 |date=2006-09-09 |publisher=[[SexTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these films still include racial stereotypes, but the segregation of actors by race has diminished considerably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.papermag.com/blogs/2007/06/becky_the_pussycats_savanna_sa.php |title=Savanna Samson: Becky &amp; the Pussycats Debut Interview |accessdate=2007-07-19 |first=Rebecca |last=Carroll |date=2007-06-04 |publisher=PaperMag.com |quote=So many girls [in the industry] said, 'Oh you can't be with [a black man] it's gonna ruin your career.'

==Racial fetishism==
In academic discourse, '''racial fetishism''' is a [[postcolonialist]] term found in the writings of authors such as [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Anne McClintock]] and [[Kobena Mercer]]. The term combines elements of the Freudian psychoanalytic fetish and the Marxist commodity fetish, and is used in the context of British and French colonialism and imperialism and their aftereffects. The term has as its origins [[Frantz Fanon]]'s '''epidermal schema''' and [[Edward Said]]'s ''Orientalism''.&lt;ref name=Bhabha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Homi Bhabha]] defined the idea of a racial fetish in contrast to the idea of the [[Freud]]ian sexual fetish which he describes a denial of difference, where the male sees the female as a castrated male, seeing missing parts rather than a different anatomy. Similar to Freud's idea of a fetish, Bhabha defines racial fetish to be a fixation on other races being not different, but lesser or &quot;mutilated&quot; versions of the white male.&lt;ref name=Bhabha&gt;{{cite journal

Research concerning the effects of [[pornography]] is inconclusive on the issue of crime.  Some studies support the contention that the viewing of pornographic material may increase rates of sexual crimes, while others have shown no effects, or a decrease in the rates of such crimes.

== Sociological studies ==
===Epidemiological studies===
An epidemiological study describes the association between given behaviors or environmental conditions, and physical or psychological health by means of observation of real-world phenomena through statistical data.  Epidemiological studies generally have high levels of [[external validity]], insofar as they accurately describe events as they occur outside of a laboratory setting, but low levels of [[internal validity]], since they do not strongly establish cause-and-effect relationships between the behaviors or conditions under study, and the health consequences observed.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks&gt;*Mitchell, M. and Jolley, J.

&quot;The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective&quot;&lt;ref name=intern&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_ovrvw.html The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt; was an epidemiological study which found that the massive growth of the pornography industry in the United States between 1975 and 1995 was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the number of sexual assaults per capita; and reported similar results for Japan.  Findings of this nature have been critiqued by Robert Peters, president of [[Morality in Media]], on the grounds that the results are better explained by factors other than the increased prevalence of pornography: &lt;blockquote&gt;a more plausible explanation is that if there is a decline in “forcible rape,” it is the result of a tremendous effort to curb rape through community and school-based programs, media coverage, aggressive law enforcement, DNA evidence, longer prison sentences, and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obscenitycrimes.org/noprevent.cfm ObscenityCrimes.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Danish criminologist [[Berl Kutchinsky]]'s ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'' (1970), a scientific report ordered by the [[Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]], found that the legalizing of pornography in [[Denmark]] had not (as expected) resulted in an increase of sex crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html [[Berl Kutchinsky]]: ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, many other experiments have been conducted, either supporting or opposing the findings of [[Berl Kutchinsky]], who would continue his study into the social effects of pornography until his death in 1995. His life's work was summed up in the publication ''Law, Pornography, and Crime: The Danish Experience'' (1999).

In stark contrast to the previously described research, in 1986 a review of epidemiological studies by Neil M. Malamuth found that the quantity of pornographic material viewed by men was positively correlated with degree to which they endorsed sexual assault.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malamuth&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Malamuth|first=Neil M.|title=Do Sexually Violent Media Indirectly Contribute to Antisocial Behavior?|publisher=Public Health Service of United States|date=August 4, 1986|pages=38|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malamuth's work describes about Check (1984) who found among a diverse sample of [[Canadian]] men that the more exposure to pornography led to higher acceptance of rape myths, violence against women, and general sexual callousness. In another study, Briere, Corne, Runtz and Malamuth (1984) reported similar correlations in a sample involving college males.  On the other hand, the failure to find a statistically significant correlation in another previous study led Malamuth to examine other interesting correlations, which took into account the information about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] the samples obtained in their childhood and pornography emerged as the second most important source of information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malamuth&quot; /&gt;

===Usage of pornography among criminals and juvenile crimes===
Silbert, M. and Pines, A., in &quot;Pornography and Sexual Abuse of Women,&quot; published their study involving prostitutes in the international journal ''Sex Roles'', &quot;The comments followed the same pattern: the assailant referred to pornographic materials he had seen or read and then insisted that the victims not only enjoyed rape but also extreme violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Silbert 857-868&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silbert|first=Mimi H. |coauthors=Ayala M. Pines|date=June, 1984|title=Pornography and sexual abuse of women|journal=Sex Roles|publisher=Springer Netherlands|volume=10|issue=11-12|pages=857-868|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t1h0056032220l05/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study, ''Use of Pornography in the Criminal and Developmental Histories of Sexual Offenders'' examined the exposure to and the usage of pornography in the histories of 38 rapists and 26 child molesters. The study found that both groups reported exposure to pornography and were &quot;significantly more likely&quot; to use pornographic materials prior to and during their offenses. According to the study pornography was employed to relieve an impulse to act out. According to the study, child molesters indicated &quot;significantly more&quot; exposure to pornography than rapists in adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel lee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=CARTER|first=DANIEL LEE |coauthors=ROBERT ALAN PRENTKY, RAYMOND A.

According to the study, &quot;''Pornography Use as a Risk Marker for an Aggressive Pattern of Behavior Among Sexually Reactive Children and Adolescents''&quot;, Sexually reactive children and adolescents ([[SRCA]]s), also referred to as [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile sexual offenders]], &quot;may be more vulnerable and likely to experience damaging effects from pornography use.&quot; According to the study,the SRCAs who used pornography were &quot;more likely&quot; to display aggressive behaviors than their nonusing counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexy|first=Eileen M. |coauthors=Ann W.

[[File:Zillmann Fig 5.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5 in &quot;Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography&quot;, [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/]]][[File:Zillmann Fig 10.png|thumb|300px|Figure 10 in &quot;Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography&quot;, [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/]]][[File:Zillmann Fig 12.png|thumb|300px|Figure 12 in &quot;Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography&quot;, [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/]]]

In this context, a controlled study describes the correlation between given behaviors or environmental conditions and health effects in a laboratory setting in which conditions other than those under study are effectively held constant across groups of participants receiving various levels of the experimental condition(s).  Since it is considered that the only functional difference between groups is the level of experimental condition(s) received, researchers can strongly infer cause-and-effect relationships from [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] associations between experimental condition(s) and health consequences.  Thus, controlled studies have high levels of [[internal validity]].  However, such studies often suffer from questionable [[external validity]] due to the considerable differences between real-world environments and laboratory settings, and the consequent belief that results cannot be generalized beyond the experimental context.  A [[double-blind study]] involves participants who are unaware of the levels of experimental condition(s) that they are receiving, and recording of data by observers who are likewise not informed of the groups to which participants have been assigned.  Double-blind studies avoid biased results due to participants' or observers' beliefs concerning the effects of the experimental condition(s).  While often performed to assess the effects of pharmaceuticals, since [[placebo]] medication can be employed, double-blind studies concerning the health consequences of viewing pornographic materials are impossible, as participants would be aware of their exposure to the experimental condition.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks/&gt;

&quot;Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/ Zillmann, Dolf: &quot;Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; was review of controlled studies which found that extensive viewing of the type of pornographic material commonly sold at adult bookstores was positively correlated with leniency in the sentencing of a person convicted of rape in a mock trial setting (figure 5), decreased satisfaction of participants with their sex lives and partners (figure 10), and an increased self-reported willingness to commit rape or other forced sexual acts (figure 12).  This line of research has been critiqued in &quot;The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective&quot; on external validity grounds:&lt;blockquote&gt;Lab experiments typically do not take into account context and other crucial social and situational factors in considering the audience or the material... In real life, individuals are free to satisfy different sexual urges in ways unavailable to students in classroom or subjects in laboratory situations.&lt;ref name=intern /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Sexual Deviation as Conditioned Behavior'', R.J. McGuire found that the viewing of pornography can serve as a source of a [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] &quot;vivid sexual fantasy&quot; which, when contemplated during masturbation, may condition men into perversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sexual Deviation as Conditioned Behavior | journal = Behavior Research and Therapy | author = R.J.

'''''Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life''''' is an original [[LMN (TV network)|Lifetime]]  [[television movie]] which was first broadcast on June 20, 2005. It was [[film director|directed]] by [[Tom McLoughlin]] and written by [[Wesley Bishop]] and [[Richard Kletter]]. The movie stars [[Jeremy Sumpter]], [[Kelly Lynch]], and [[Lyndsy Fonseca]].

==Plot==
{{plot|date=August 2008}}
''Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life'' is the story of Justin Peter, a 16-year-old boy who discovers [[internet pornography]]. The film establishes Justin as a popular student with a steady girlfriend, and a successful swimmer who had just made the All-State team. However, as his obsession with porn increases, he loses interest in everything his life had consisted of up until now: school, his swimming career, his parents, his friends, and his girlfriend, Amy. 

Justin is introduced to pornography when a friend sends him a link to a [[softcore]] site featuring Monica, a fellow student who has a crush on him. Enthralled by the images, Justin is later exposed to a [[porn film]] at a party, and later browses more explicit pornographic websites, only to be caught by his mother Diane. She tells her husband, but he just brushes her off, telling her that it is natural for teenage boys to look at pictures of girls.

Justin's late nights in front of the computer and increasing obsession with porn soon impact upon his lap times, and he betrays Amy's trust by downloading porn on to her [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]. He also exposes his younger brother Alex to porn, leaving him queasy. Justin soon begins to gain a reputation at school of being a &quot;porn freak&quot; after showing his friends [[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]] porn. Eventually, his addiction causes him to almost miss the All-State swim finals, where he places third. However, Justin's mother is disappointed at the result.

Discovering a [[CD-R]] titled Virgin Vaginas that Justin had burned his porn on to, Diane confronts him and moves Justin's computer out of his room. However, this doesn't stop him, and he continues to surreptitiously surf the web for porn, eventually racking up extensive bills on his parent's credit cards, bringing attention to Diane about his addiction. She later discovers a co-worker's marriage had been destroyed by her ex-husband's [[pornography addiction|porn addiction]], alarming her further.  Justin also goes to the extent of using a computer at school to access pornography and gets caught hacking the internet firewall to do so.  As a result of that, he is suspended from the swim team and on placed on overall probation.

Meanwhile, Justin has become closer to Monica, but increasingly ignores his girlfriend. Eventually, after being pressured to have sex with him, Amy breaks up with Justin.  Justin meets with Monica and she tries to seduce him. However, unsure of the situation, he hesitates and an angry Monica kicks him out of her house.  Monica then throws a physical tantrum alone after feeling rejected by Justin and bangs her own head causing it to bleed.  

Soon after, Justin then tries to make amends with Amy and turn his life around.  After leaving Amy and walking down the street, he is noticed by another schoolmate who relays to other schoolmates at a nearby restaurant that he is close by.  Monica is sitting with the schoolmates with noticeable face injuries and it is presumed she told the others that Justin was responsible for them.  The schoolmates track down Justin and beat him up on the street, disturbed by his reputation as a &quot;porn freak&quot; and the incident with Monica.

Depressed after being physically attacked, Justin arrives at the school's swimming pool and leaps in feeling that he is at rock bottom (presumably to drown himself).  Earlier in the movie, he would be under the water fantasizing about women and pornography being near him but this time he thinks of all the things he has to live for.  He sees images of his mother and family, the cheering that took place from the crowd when he swam, and other positive feelings.  He saves himself and apparently breaks his addiction.

==Reaction==
The movie drew significant attention from [[online communities]], who generally criticized the heavy handedness the film took in trying to get its message across, and mocked the numerous ways the film tried to present the subject matter in a way suitable for the general viewing audience of the Lifetime Network. 

For example, the &quot;pornography&quot; shown during the course of the film could be considered excessively tame in its depiction, with no nudity and little reference to sexual activity evident. Justin is also never suggested to [[masturbate]] upon delving into his addiction, with commentators joking about how he seems to develop an [[energy drink]] addiction to represent this instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=3006 |title=Something Awful: Review of ''Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life'' |accessdate=2007-04-07 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators were also quick to point out that actress [[Kelly Lynch]], who plays Justin's concerned mother Diane Peterson, has made numerous nude appearances in other films herself, of which images are widely available on the internet. 

Another problem that some viewers had with the movie is that while the main character's life does indeed go into a downward spiral, it is debatable how much of it was actually caused by pornography.  Most of the main character's problems can be seen as resulting from his parents' intolerance and the actions of other characters. It is also suggested the movie had too close ties to [[religion]] to be even handed in its representation of pornography and overly negative portrayal of pornography. 

''Cyber Seduction: His Secret Life'' has been widely compared to the infamous ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' which, in similar vein to ''Cyber Seduction'', warned against the dangers of [[marijuana]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seaswell.wordpress.com/2007/09/05/i-watched-cyber-seduction-his-secret-life/ |title=Something  different'' |accessdate=2007-04-07 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is established since as early as 1960s.

'''Internet addiction disorder''' ('''IAD'''), or, more broadly, ''Internet overuse'', ''problematic computer use'' or ''pathological computer use'', is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.  These terms avoid the distracting and divisive term ''[[addiction]]'' and are not limited to any single cause.

IAD was originally proposed as a [[psychological disorder|disorder]] in a [[satire|satirical]] [[hoax]] by [[Ivan Goldberg]], M.D., in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nurseweek.com/features/97-8/iadct.html Internet Addiction?] August 8, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
He took [[pathological gambling]] as diagnosed by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] ([[DSM-IV]]) as his model for the description&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psycom.net/iadcriteria.html|title=Internet Addictive Disorder (IAD)Diagnostic Criteria|accessed=2009 January 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; of IAD.
However, IAD receives coverage in the press, and its classification as a psychological disorder is being debated and researched.

Online activities which, if done in person, would normally be considered troublesome, such as compulsive gambling or shopping, are sometimes called ''net compulsions''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netaddiction.com/net_compulsions.htm Types of Internet addiction?]&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as reading or playing computer games, are troubling only to the extent that these activities interfere with normal life. 
Supporters of disorder classification often divide IAD into subtypes by activity, such as excessive viewing of [[pornography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02049/types_1.htm |title=Internet addiction Disorder: The Mind Prison-types |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
overwhelming and excessive [[gaming]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02049/types_2.htm Internet addiction Disorder: The Mind Prison-types 2]&lt;/ref&gt;
inappropriate involvement in online [[Social network service|social networking]] sites or [[blogging]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02049/types_4.htm Internet addiction Disorder: The Mind Prison-types 4]&lt;/ref&gt;
and Internet [[shopping addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netaddiction.com/resources/ebay_addiction.html eBay Addiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible disorder==
There is debate over whether or not to include &quot;Internet Addiction&quot; as a diagnosis in DSM-V, the next (2012) edition of the DSM.
Some argue that Internet addiction disorder exists and should be included, and some that it is neither an addiction nor a specific disorder and should not be included in DSM-V.

One argument for inclusion is that (in America, for example) it would open the doors for insurance to pay for Internet addiction counseling.
A counter-argument is that there is no evidence that needed treatment is being denied, as treatment is coded under existing labels according to the underlying symptoms.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In June 2007, the [[American Medical Association]] declined to recommend to the [[American Psychiatric Association]] that they include IAD as a formal diagnosis in DSM-V,&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychcentral.com/news/2007/06/26/video-games-no-addiction-for-now/ Video Games No Addiction For Now] June, 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended further study of &quot;video game overuse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes Phạm&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical association backs off labeling 'video-game addiction'|author=Alex Phạm|first=Alex|last=Phạm|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2007-06-22|page=C1|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1292728181.html?dids=1292728181:1292728181&amp;FMT=ABS}}&lt;!-- http://news.cincypost.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070628/NEWS01/706280356 --&gt;&lt;!-- http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CNPB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=11A1482975669BC8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Some members of the [[American Society of Addiction Medicine]] opposed identifying [[Internet overuse]] and [[video game overuse]] as disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/fun.games/06/25/addiction.video.games.reut/index.html Experts: Video games not an addiction] June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Among the research identified as necessary are  a ways to define &quot;overuse&quot; and to differentiate an &quot;Internet addiction&quot; from [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]], [[self-medication]] for depression or other disorders, and [[Compulsive behavior|compulsion]].

While the existence of Internet addiction is debated, self-proclaimed sufferers are resorting to the courts for redress. In one American case (Pacenza v. IBM Corp.), the plaintiff argued he was illegally terminated in violation of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] because of Internet addiction triggered by [[Vietnam War]]-related [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=9942461|title=Internet Addiction: The Next Disability|accessed=2009 Jan 31|publisher=LRP Publications|date=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The case is pending before the court in the Southern District of New York (case summarized in Glaser &amp; Carroll, 2007).

===Support===
According to [[Maressa Orzack]], director of the Computer Addiction Study Center at [[Harvard University]]'s [[McLean Hospital]], between 5% and 10% of Web surfers suffer some form of Web dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another supporter, [[David Greenfield]], Ph.D. of the Center for Internet Behavior conducted a study with [[ABC News]].com in 1999 and is author of ''Virtual Addiction.''  He believes that some services available over the [[Internet]] have unique psychological properties which induce [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], time distortion, and instant gratification, with about 6% of individuals experiencing some significant impact on their lives. However, he says it may not best be seen as an addiction but rather as a [[Compulsive behavior|compulsion]].  Greenfield claims that sex, gaming, gambling, and shopping online can produce a mood-altering effect. 

According to the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery (whose director is Kimberly S. Young, a researcher who has lobbied for the recognition of net abuse as a distinct clinical disorder), &quot;Internet addicts suffer from emotional problems such as depression and anxiety-related disorders and often use the fantasy world of the Internet to psychologically escape unpleasant feelings or stressful situations.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netaddiction.com/faq.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Netaddiction.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 60% of people seeking treatment for IAD claim involvement with sexual activities online which they consider inappropriate, such as excessive attention to pornography or involvement in explicit sexual conversations online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netaddiction.com/cybersexual_addiction.htm |title=Cybersex/Cyberporn Addiction |publisher=Netaddiction.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half are also addicted to alcohol, drugs, tobacco, or sex.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In a 2008 [[editorial]] published in the [[American Journal of Psychiatry]], Jerald J. Block, M.D. argues that Internet addiction should be included as a disorder in the DSM-V.  He notes that symptoms of IA mirror other compulsive/impulsive disorders, including: 1.) excessive use (often associated with a loss of sense of time); 2.) [[withdrawal]] symptoms when access is denied; 3.) increasing tolerance (including growing needs for exposure to obtain the same effects); and, 4.) negative repercussions (including social isolation). He further observed that diagnosis was complicated because 86% of study subjects showing IA symptoms also exhibited other diagnosable mental health disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/165/3/306|title=Issues for DSM-V: Internet Addiction|date=March 2008|accessed=January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
IAD suffers first from its misleading title.  Psychiatrist Dr. Goldberg acknowledges that Internet addiction disorder is not a true addiction and may in fact be no more than a symptom of other, existing disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news82749930.html |title=Experts debate Internet addiction |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An overbroad description of addiction leaves open the possibility of every compensatory behavior being declared an addiction.  For example, a person who has lengthy telephone conversations with a friend to avoid an unpleasant situation could be declared &quot;addicted to the telephone&quot; with equal validity as a person who chats on the Internet with the same underlying goal.

Many others, including [[Carol Potera]], agree that Internet addiction is inappropriately named. To the extent that the Internet is a social medium instead of an object, people cannot be addicted to it.  The analogy is made to an environment:  a person can not be truly addicted to living in a favorite town (no matter how distressing a change of home might be), and a goldfish can not be addicted to living in a pond.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Secondly, it is widely recognized, even by its supporters, that most if not all &quot;Internet addicts&quot; already fall under existing, legitimate diagnostic labels.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/01/fashion/thursdaystyles/01addict.html?ex=1184731200&amp;en=29b02b567c2ef1ef&amp;ei=5070 Hooked on the Web: Help Is on the Way]&lt;/ref&gt;  For many patients, overuse or inappropriate use of the Internet is merely a manifestation of their [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[impulse control]] disorders, or [[pathological gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netaddiction.com/newspr/press_release_index.htm#PR4 Press Releases #4 at netaddiction.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In this criticism, IAD is compared to [[food addiction]], in which patients overeat as a form of self-medication for depression, anxiety, etc., without actually being truly [[addiction|addicted]] to eating.

It is possible that a person could have a pathological relationship with a specific aspects of the Internet, such as bidding on [[online auctions]], viewing [[pornography]], online gaming, or online gambling (which is included under the existing [[Problem gambling#Pathological gambling|Pathological Gambling]]), but that does not make the Internet medium itself be addictive.  Here are common problems which are improperly lumped together under the IAD label:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netaddiction.com/newspr/press_release_index.htm#PR4 Press Release #4 at netaddiction.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* A pathological gambler is a pathological gambler regardless of whether the gambling is done on a computer or face-to-face.  
* A person with poor impulse control can lose sleep over a suspenseful novel or favorite television show just as easily as he or she can lose sleep over an exciting computer game or the temptation to click on another web link.
* A person with a sexual obsession is still a person with a sexual obsession, whether the pornography is viewed on a screen or on paper. 
* A person who shops obsessively (including during a [[manic]] phase) has an obsessive shopping problem whether the purchases are made in person, by mail, by phone, or online. 
* A problem day trader, who has a form of pathological gambling, is still a problem day trader regardless of whether the stock trading is done by computer, over the phone, or face-to-face. 

Also, there are significant and critical differences between common Internet activities (e-mail, chatting, web surfing) and pathological gambling, which the IAD notion heavily parallels.  The Internet is largely a pro-social, interactive, and information-driven medium, while gambling is seen as a single, anti-social behavior that has very little social redeeming value.  So-called Internet addicts do not suffer from the same damage to health and relationships that are common to established addictions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Indeed, researchers (Padillar-Walker et al., 2009) have noted that it is the content that people interact with online that can cause problematic behaviors—not the medium. When the Internet was used for prosocial activities or schoolwork, the researchers noted positive outcomes amongst those studied. When it was used for negative or antisocial activities, they noted a higher incidence of negative outcomes.{{Citation needed|August 2009|Can't verify, requires BYU login, it appears. An associated edit was a copyvio.|date=August 2009}}

A complete review of the Internet addiction research at the end of 2008 (Byun et al., 2008) demonstrated significant, multiple flaws in most studies in this area. The researchers wrote in that article, &quot;The analysis showed that previous studies have utilized inconsistent criteria to define Internet addicts, applied recruiting methods that may cause serious sampling bias, and examined data using primarily exploratory rather than confirmatory data analysis techniques to investigate the degree of association rather than causal relationships among variables.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CPandB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|coauthors=Sookeun Byun, Celestino Ruffini, Juline E.

==Prevalence of Internet overuse==
The Ottawa Sun reports that a 1996 report in the UK &quot;Advances in Psychiatric Treatment&quot; claimed that a &quot;significant minority&quot; suffer from &quot;Internet addiction&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ottawa&gt;{{cite web | Sharon Kirkey | title =Recognize Internet addiction as a mental illness | publisher=The Ottawa Citizen | work =Internet addiction | url=http://www.health.am/psy/more/recognize-internet-addiction-as-a-mental-illness/ | year = 2007 | accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries in Asia, particularly Taiwan, South Korea, and China, have been reported to have the highest incidence of computer or Internet addiction among young people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009|I think this introductory material is sourced below, but perhaps the sources should be named and citations added here?}}

Up to 30 percent of South Koreans under 18, or about 2.4 million people, are at risk of Internet addiction, said Ahn Dong-hyun, a child psychiatrist at Hanyang University in Seoul who just completed a three-year government-financed survey of the problem.&lt;ref name=nytimes.com&gt;{{cite web | Martin Fackler | title =In Korea, a Boot Camp Cure for Web Obsession | publisher=New York Times | work = | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/technology/18rehab.html | year = 2007 | accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), as of June 30, 2006, showed that 123 million people had gone online, of which 14.9% were teenagers below 18 years old. Chou and Hsiao reported that the incidence rate of Internet addiction among [[Taiwan]] college students was 5.9%.&lt;ref name=Comput_Educ&gt;{{cite journal | author = C. Chou and M.C.

One Beijing judge, Shan Xiuyun, claimed that 85 percent of juvenile crime in the city was Internet-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1646663,00.html  China's young escape into the web]   November 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Youth League|China Communist Youth League]] claimed in 2007 that over 17 percent of Chinese citizens between 13 and 17 are addicted to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificepoch.com/newsstories/86510_0_5_0_M/ 17% Of Youth Addicted To Internet] January 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Block (2008) cites recent research data that suggested that 13.7% of Chinese adolescents—roughly 10 million people—met the diagnostic criterion for Internet addiction. That insight, reportedly, led to China to restrict use of computers for gaming to three hours per day (2008).

==Prevention and correction==
In many cases, though not all, Internet overuse corrects itself.  Sarah Kershaw wrote for the New York Times in 2005:  &quot;It was Professor Kiesler who called Internet addiction a fad illness. In her view, she said, [[television addiction]] is worse. She added that she was completing a study of heavy Internet users, which showed the majority had sharply reduced their time on the computer over the course of a year, indicating that even problematic use was self-corrective.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/01/fashion/thursdaystyles/01addict.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=29b02b567c2ef1ef&amp;ex=1184731200 Hooked on the Web: Help Is on the Way]&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrective strategies include [[content-control software]], counseling, and [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucc.nd.edu/self-help/internet-dependence University of Notre Dame Counceling Center, &quot;Self help - Lost in Cyberspace&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02049/text_el/treatments_prev.htm Preventions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02049/text_el/treatments_post.htm Post-treatments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/06aug/02049/text_el/treatments_self.htm Self-help strategies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Families in China have turned to unlicensed training camps that offer to &quot;wean&quot; their children, often in their teens, from overuse of the Internet, resulting in the death of at least one youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/19/china.internet/index.html?iref=mpstoryview|title=China probe of abuse at Web addiction camp|last=Krajnak|first=Deb|date=2009-08-19|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pornography''' or '''porn''' is the depiction of explicit [[Human sexuality|sexual]] subject matter for the purposes of sexual excitement.

Over the past few decades, an immense industry for the production and consumption of pornography has grown, with the increasing use of the [[VCR]], the [[DVD]], and the [[Internet]], as well as the emergence of social attitudes more tolerant of sexual portrayals. Performers in pornography are referred to as [[pornographic actor]]s (or actresses), or the more commonly known title &quot;[[porn star]]&quot; and are generally seen as qualitatively different from their mainstream counterparts. [[Amateur pornography]] has become widely popular and generally distributed via the Internet for free.

Pornography may use any of a variety of media, ranging from printed [[literature]], [[photograph|photos]], [[sculpture]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[animation]], [[sound recording]], [[Pornographic film|film]], [[video]], or [[video game]]. However, when sexual acts are performed for a live audience, by definition it is not pornography, as the term applies to the depiction of the act, rather than the act itself. Thus, portrayals such as [[sex show]]s and [[striptease]] are not classified as pornography.

In most countries pornography is considered and treated differently, both culturally and legally, from [[depictions of nudity]] in art or [[nude photography|photography]].

==Etymology==
The word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πορνογραφία (''pornographia''), which derives from the Greek words πόρνη (''pornē,'' &quot;[[prostitute]]&quot; and  ''pornea,'' &quot;prostitution&quot;), and γράφω (''graphō,'' &quot;I write or record,&quot; derived meaning  &quot;illustration,&quot; cf. &quot;[[graph]]&quot;), and the  suffix -ία (''-ia'', meaning &quot;state of,&quot; &quot;property of,&quot; or &quot;place of&quot;), thus meaning &quot;a written description or illustration of prostitutes or prostitution.&quot;

{{details|History of erotic depictions}}

The depiction of sexual acts is as old as civilization (and can be found painted on various ancient buildings), but the concept of pornography as understood today did not exist until the [[Victorian era]]. Previous to that time, though some sex acts were regulated or stipulated in laws, looking at objects or images depicting them was not. In some cases, specific books, engravings or image collections were censored or outlawed, but the trend to compose laws that restricted viewing of sexually explicit things in general was a Victorian construct. When large scale excavations of [[Pompeii]] were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the [[Roman Empire]]. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper class scholars.
The moveable objects were locked away in the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Secret Museum]] in [[Naples, Italy]] and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. Soon after, the world's first law criminalizing pornography was enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1857 in the [[Obscene Publications Act]]. The Victorian attitude that pornography was for a select few can be seen in the wording of the [[Hicklin test]] stemming from a court case in 1868 where it asks, &quot;whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences.&quot; Despite the fact of their suppression, depictions of erotic imagery were common throughout history.&lt;ref name = libido7&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: Victorian Obsessions and Fin-de-Siècle Predilections| publisher = Libido, The Journal of Sex and Sensibility| month=  May | year=  2003| url = http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn07.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-genres==
{{Main|List of pornographic sub-genres}}
In general, [[softcore]] refers to pornography that does not depict [[Sexual penetration|penetration]] (usually [[genitals]] are not shown right on camera), and [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] refers to pornography that depicts penetration explicitly.

Pornography takes different forms depending on physical characteristics of the participants, fetish, sexual orientation, etc. Reality and voyeur pornography, [[Animation|animated]] videos, and legally prohibited acts also influence the classification of pornography. Some popular genres of pornography include:

*[[Alt porn]]
*[[Amateur pornography]]
*[[Sexual Fetishism|Fetish pornography]]
*[[Sexual orientation|Orientation-based pornography]] (''heterosexual pornography''; [[gay pornography]]; [[lesbian pornography]]; [[bisexual pornography]])
*[[Group sex|Orgy pornography]]
*[[Race-oriented pornography]] (e.g. [[Asian people|Asian]], [[black]], [[Latino]], [[interracial pornography|interracial]])
*[[Reality pornography]]
*[[Voyeurism|Voyeur pornography]] (e.g. hidden camera pornography, &quot;upskirt&quot; pornography)

==Economics==

{{Main|Porn industry}}

Revenues of the adult industry in the United States have been difficult to determine. In 1970, a Federal study estimated that the total retail value of all the hard-core porn in the United States was no more than $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography]]. ''Report of The Commission on Obscenity and Pornography'' 1970, [[Washington, D.C.]]: [[United States Government Printing Office|U. S. Government Printing Office]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Forrester Research]] published a report on the online &quot;adult content&quot; industry estimating  $750 million to $1 billion in annual revenue. As an unsourced aside, the Forrester study speculated on an industry-wide aggregate figure of $8–10 billion, which was repeated out of context in many news stories,&lt;ref name=&quot;AlternetNaked&quot;&gt;{{cite news

A significant amount of pornographic video is shot in the [[San Fernando Valley]], which has been a pioneering region for producing adult films since the 1970s, and has since become home for various models, actors/actresses, production companies, and other assorted businesses involved in the production and distribution of pornography.

===Non-commercial pornography===

As well as the porn industry, there is a large amount of non-commercial pornography. This should be distinguished from commercial pornography falsely marketed as featuring &quot;amateurs.&quot; The [http://www.asstr.org Alt Sex Stories Text Repository] focuses on prose stories collected from [[Usenet]]. Various Usenet groups are focused on non-commercial pornographic photographs.

==Technology==

Mass-distributed pornography is as old as the printing press. Almost as soon as photography was invented, it was being used to produce pornographic images. Some claim{{Who|date=October 2007}} that pornography has been a driving force in the development of technologies from the [[printing press]], through [[photography]] (still and motion), to [[video]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]], [[DVD]], and the [[Internet]]. With the invention of tiny [[camera]]s and wireless equipments [[voyeur pornography]] is gaining ground. [[Mobile camera]]s are used to capture pornographic photos or videos, and forwarded as [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]].

===Computer-generated images and manipulations===

Digital manipulation requires the use of source photographs, but some pornography is produced without human actors at all. The idea of completely [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] pornography was conceived very early as one of the most obvious areas of application for computer graphics and 3D rendering.

Until the late 1990s, digitally manipulated pornography could not be produced cost-effectively. In the early 2000s, it became a growing segment, as the modelling and animation software matured and the rendering capabilities of computers improved. As of 2004, computer-generated pornography depicting situations involving children and sex with [[fictional character]]s, such as [[Lara Croft]], is already produced on a limited scale. The October 2004 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' featured topless pictures of the title character from the ''[[BloodRayne]]'' video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ | title=Playboy undressed video game women - Aug. 25, 2004 | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and distribution by region==

{{Main|Pornography by region}}
The [[Film production|production]] and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] of pornography are economic activities of some importance. The exact size of the economy of pornography and the influence that it has in political circles are matters of controversy.

==Legal status==

{{Sex and the Law}}
:''See [[List of pornography laws by region]] for detailed list''
The legal status of pornography varies widely from country to country. Most countries allow at least some form of pornography. In some countries, softcore pornography is considered tame enough to be sold in general stores or to be shown on TV. Hardcore pornography, on the other hand, is usually regulated. The production and sale, and to a slightly lesser degree the possession, of [[child pornography]] is illegal in almost all countries, and most countries have restrictions on pornography involving [[Rape pornography|violence]] or [[Zoophilia|animals]].
[[Image:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Pornographic entertainment on display in a [[sex shop]] window.  There is usually a minimum age to go into pornographic stores.]]
Most countries attempt to restrict minors' access to hardcore materials, limiting availability to [[adult bookstore]]s, mail-order, and television channels that parents can restrict, among other means. There is usually an age minimum for entrance to pornographic stores, or the materials are displayed partly covered or not displayed at all. More generally, [[disseminating pornography to a minor]] is often illegal. Many of these efforts have been rendered practically irrelevant by widely available [[Internet pornography]].

In the United States, a person receiving unwanted [[Direct marketing|commercial mail]] he or she deems pornographic (or otherwise offensive) may obtain a [[Prohibitory Order]], either against all mail from a particular sender, or against all sexually explicit mail, by applying to the [[United States Postal Service]].

There are recurring [[urban legend]]s of [[snuff movie]]s, in which murders are filmed for pornographic purposes. Despite extensive work to ascertain the truth of these rumors, law enforcement officials have been unable to find any such works.

The Internet has also caused problems with the enforcement of age limits regarding performers and subjects. In most countries, males and females under the age of 18 are not allowed to appear in porn films, but in several European countries the age limit is 16, and in Denmark it is legal for women as young as 16 to appear topless in mainstream newspapers and magazines.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This material often ends up on the Internet and can be viewed by people in countries where it constitutes child pornography, creating challenges for lawmakers wishing to restrict access to such material.

Some people, including pornography producer [[Larry Flynt]] and the writer [[Salman Rushdie]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesRushdie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article466971.ece|title= Porn is vital to freedom, says Rushdie|accessdate= 2007-11-08|last= Baxter|first= Sarah|coauthors= Brooks, Richard|date=  2004-08-08|work= Times Online|publisher= Times Newspapers|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5TD5Q8UAz|archivedate= 2007-11-08|quote= Pornography exists everywhere, of course, but when it comes into societies in which it’s difficult for young men and women to get together and do what young men and women often like doing, it satisfies a more general need.... While doing so, it sometimes becomes a kind of standard-bearer for freedom, even civilisation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that pornography is vital to freedom and that a free and civilized society should be judged by its willingness to accept pornography.

The UK Government has criminalised possession of what it terms &quot;[[extreme pornography]]&quot; following the highly publicised murder of [[Jane Longhurst]].

==Effect on sexual aggression==
{{Main|Social effects of pornography}}
Research concerning the effects of pornography is inconclusive. Some studies support the contention that the viewing of pornographic material may increase rates of sexual crimes, while others have shown no effects, or a decrease in the rates of such crimes. Moreover, all these studies focus on various correlations, but [[correlation does not imply causation]].

==Anti-pornography movement==
[[Image:La grande Epidemie de PORNOGRAPHIE.jpg|thumb|A French [[caricature]] on &quot;the great epidemic of pornography.&quot;]]
{{Main|Anti-pornography movement}}

Opposition to pornography comes generally, though not exclusively, from several sources: [[law]], [[religion]] and [[feminism]]. 

===Feminist objections===
{{Main|Feminist views on pornography}}
[[Feminist]] critics of pornography, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]], generally consider it demeaning to women. They believe that most pornography eroticizes the [[Male dominance|domination]], [[Erotic humiliation|humiliation]], and [[coercion]] of women, reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]], and contributes to the male-centered [[objectification]] of women. 

===Legal objections===
{{See also|Legal objections to pornography in the United States}}

===Religious objections===
{{Main|Religious views on pornography}}
Some religious groups discourage members from viewing pornography, and support legislation restricting its publication. These positions derive from broader religious beliefs about human sexuality. In some religious traditions, for example, sexual intercourse is limited to the sole function of procreation. Thus, sexual pleasure or sex-oriented entertainment, as well as lack of modesty, are considered to be immoral.

'''Steven Toushin''' (born [[August 6]], [[1946]] in Brooklyn, NY) is an American producer and distributor of [[Gay pornography|gay pornographic]] and [[BDSM]] films who has operated adult theaters and sex clubs since 1970.  Toushin owns and manages the [[Bijou Theater (Chicago)|Bijou Theater]] in [[Chicago]], the oldest gay adult theater and sex club in the United States&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1454 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  and has produced multiple underground and classic pornographic films and published several books on the matter. He has been a defendant in the United States justice system continuously from 1969 until the present; he has defended himself and his companies in twenty-one obscenity cases including two federal obscenity trials; and has suffered thirty-five personal arrests and over 200 busts to his businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Toushin, Steven, ''The Destruction of the Moral Fabric of America'', (Wells Street Publishing, 2006). ISBN 978-1-884760-04-4. &lt;/ref&gt;  

==Career==

Steven Toushin was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York.  He left New York in 1963 at the age of 17, arrived in Chicago in the summer of 1968 and took over management of the now-defunct Aardvark Theater there. The Aardvark, which screened 16mm experimental and documentary films and was on verge of bankruptcy, began turning a profit by screening [[art film]]s that displayed nudity. In 1970 Toushin and partners bought the theater and other theaters and sex clubs throughout [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], [[Indianapolis]], [[East Chicago]] and [[Gary|Gary, Indiana]], including the Festival, Termite, 3-Penny, Eden, Savages, and Bijou Theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Possley, Maurice (June 22,1988). “Theater Owner Target of Porn Probe”, The Chicago Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these only the Bijou remains open.

Toushin's first arrest for obscenity occurred in 1969 for screening the underground classic film [[Flaming Creatures]] by [[Jack Smith]].  Obscenity charges were brought under Illinois state law. In 1970 similar charges were brought for screening [[I Am Curious (Yellow)]] in Indianapolis, in 1973 for [[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]] and in 1974 for ''Teenage Fantasies''. The case resulting from the 1974 arrest was dismissed after a two week jury trial: Toushin also defended himself in two federal obscenity suits regarding BDSM . His first federal obscenity trial occurred in 1973 for screening ''Ranch Slaves''.&lt;ref&gt;Ricciardi v. Thompson, 480 F.2d. 167 (7th Cir. June 25, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

Toushin published ''The Bijou Video Catalog'' from 1980 to 1995.  With the advent of video in the early 1980s Toushin became a major distributor of gay pornographic and [[BDSM]] films.  In 1988 four of his BDSM films attracted federal obscenity charges brought under then-[[Meese Report|Attorney General Meese's Commission on Pornography]].

==1989 Federal obscenity trial==

Toushin's second federal obscenity suit began in July 1988 when grand juries in Tennessee and  Utah indicted him for the distribution of ''Erotic Hands'', ''The Final Chapter of Mistress Ann'', ''You Said a Mouthful'', and ''Please Sir'', films that depict extremely brutal and degrading [[sadomasochism|S/M]] scenes.  Nonetheless, Toushin argued that his [[BDSM]] films were not legally obscene. At the time of indictment, the U.S. government was conducting a third investigation in Nebraska and an indictment there followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toushin 1989&quot;&gt;U.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1455 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; All three investigations were the product of a federal program named “Operation PostPorn” which comprised a nationwide federal investigation spanning 9 U.S. cities and led to the indictment of 20 people and 14 corporations including Toushin and his companies.&lt;ref&gt;Possley, Maurice (July 2,1988). “20 Indicted in Mailing Pornography”, The Chicago Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The U.S. Government sought indictments for &quot;obscenity by the standards of a local community&quot; by ordering U.S. Postal Inspectors in Tennessee, Utah, and Nebraska to order catalogs and magazines from Toushin's businesses located in Chicago, IL.  Tennessee District Judge John T. Nixon stated that “there is no established evidence that the films involved in this case have ever been sent to the jurisdiction by defendants except for those copies ordered by the Government.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Toushin 1989&quot;/&gt; Toushin asked the Tennessee court to transfer his case to Northern Illinois but Judge Nixon refused, stating that the appropriate finder of fact is a jury selected from the community in which the offense took place and that such a transfer should only be granted when there is “intentional overreaching” by the government.  Nixon found that “although the Government took measures inducing the defendants to mail allegedly obscene materials to Middle Tennessee, the defendants made a deliberate decision to conduct business here [by mailing the materials].”&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1457 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; (''see'' [[Miller test]])

Toushin defended himself from federal obscenity charges by arguing that his films were “predominately violent” and did not appeal to a prurient, sick, shameful, morbid or unhealthy interest in sex. He brought expert witnesses to testify that average members of the BDSM community would not have a prurient interest in these films. The experts were psychotherapist Guy Baldwin, Dr. Robert Stoller, Dr. Richard Green, anthropologist Professor Gregerson, gay S/M activists Gayle Rubin, Jim Ward, Geoff Mains, Tony DeBlase, Dr. Andrew Charles, John Rowberry and Barry Douglas from GMSMA. He also argued that the material had scientific value as the films offer  insight into violent psychological dispositions or an unhealthy interest in violence. Toushin's attorneys stated that the films present a problem in that they may appeal to an unhealthy interest in violence.  However, to convict Toushin for distributing extremely violent films would be a misuse of obscenity law.  

Judge Nixon had consistently demonstrated his displeasure with the U.S. Government for “attempt[ing] to fabricate venue.”&lt;ref&gt;U.S. v. Toushin, 714 F.Supp. 1452 at 1456 (M.D.Tenn. April 21, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  Within 2 hours of the jury exiting the courtroom for deliberation, the U.S. Government approached Toushin's attorneys and offered to settle the case. Toushin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to use the U.S. mails to distribute obscene material and the U.S. government agreed to drop proceedings in Utah and Nebraska and to appoint Judge Nixon as the sentencing judge.  In August 1989, Judge Nixon ordered Toushin to serve five years probation and fined Toushin's two businesses $250,000 each. The four movies at issue were never confiscated and the U.S. Government did not ask the court to enjoin against their future distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''AtomAge''''' magazine (later '''''AtomAge International''''' magazine) was a [[fetish magazine]] published in Britain by the clothes designer [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|John Sutcliffe]] in the 1970s as an offshoot of his AtomAge fetish clothing business.  The first AtomAge clothing catalogue was published in 1965; the first issue of the magazine in A5 format was published in 1972 remaining in print until 1980. The magazine specialized in [[leather fetishism|leather]], [[rubber and PVC fetishism]], with a heavy emphasis on rubber and leather [[catsuit]]s, [[cloak]]s, and [[gasmask]]s. In 1981, the publication was split in two: '''''AtomAge Rubberist''''' (similar to the original '''AtomAge''') and '''''AtomAge Bondage''''' (which contained more overtly [[S&amp;M]] content).  [[John Sutcliffe (designer)|Sutcliffe]] made this decision because the [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]] material he began to introduce in the late 1970s issues of the original '''''AtomAge''''' bothered some rubber enthusiasts. Both magazines remained in print until 1985.

One of Sutcliffe's main goals was to dignify the popular perception of fetish. He is regarded as one of the patron saints of the world-wide Rubberist community as a result.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Splosh!''''' is a British [[fetish magazine]] devoted to [[wet and messy fetishism]]. It features pictures of, and stories about, women in wet and messy situations. First published in 1989, it is run by Bill Shipton and his partner and model Hayley.

The magazine ended after 40 issues, and is widely regarded as the quintessential publication on the fetish, even giving rise to the eponymous term '''[[sploshing]]'''.&lt;ref name=Sex encyclopedia entry on Sploshing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuckknows.org/wiki/index.php?title=Sploshing|title=Sex encyclopedia entry on Sploshing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Splosh website has now taken over, and although the magazine is defunct for now, new models and the classics continue to model and take part in video sketches, such as Sammy Jane, Anne Marie Dixon and Decadent Doll.

'''''Justice Weekly'' Magazine''' was a popular [[Canada|Canadian]] [[tabloid]] publication that was published weekly from 1949 until 1972. It featured news about Canadian and International [[criminal justice]] cases, and issues concerned with [[punishment]] (especially [[corporal punishment]]) in institutional and domestic environments. 

''Justice Weekly'' also featured considerable erotically-oriented content particularly concerned with [[discipline]] and [[cross-dressing]] themes of particular interest to [[fetishism]] enthusiasts. It ceased publication when its publisher retired.

== History ==
''Justice Weekly'', although containing quite [[bizarre]] content, (especially a letters section where correspondents would convey various *presumably largely fictional* experiences in situations involving punishment, cross-dressing, [[humiliation]] and [[discipline]] in domestic situations or scholastic/[[authoritarian]] environments, and personal advertisements where fetishists could contact others of like-interests) was quite widely read and enjoyed a large circulation most of its existence.

A 1950's [[Pierre Berton]] newspaper column in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' newspaper indicated ''Justice Weekly'' had a circulation not far behind'' [[Maclean's]]'' at that time, and enjoyed higher circulation than many more mainstream magazines in Canada, including well known publications such as ''[[Time]]'' and ''[[Chatelaine magazine|Chatelaine]]''. Berton expressed amazement that such sensational content had such wide distribution yet so little prominence in the public imagination.

Many larger library periodical collections in Canada maintain a ''Justice Weekly'' archive. Similar archives are kept by some [[LGBT]] organizations, and ''Justice Weekly'' articles and letters are occasionally reprinted or published on the internet in fetish websites.

''Justice Weekly'' content had some recurring themes; popular topics were discipline, punishment and humiliation of males (especially 'errant husbands' and spoiled post-[[adolescent]] children) by authoritarian/domineering females, [[transvestites]] and [[authority figure]]s such as school principals, judges and [[law-enforcement]] officials.

Despite the fetish related aspects of much of the editorial and advertising content of ''Justice Weekly'', it is considered a reliable source of news and its journalism was regarded as reliable in the most part. When several infants in Canada in the late 1960s suffered botched [[circumcisions]] (in one case leading to the child being given a [[sex assignment|sex reassignment]] and raised as a female) ''Justice Weekly'' reported the story and the malpractice judgement against the physician responsible. News stories that had any fetish/[[erotic]] potential for persons with interests in [[Sadism and masochism]], [[bondage and domination]], cross-dressing or corporal punishment were of particular interest editorially to ''Justice Weekly''. Many details of these stories emerged in'' Justice Weekly'' that would have been regarded as too-risque to print in the 'family'-oriented daily newspapers and newsmagazines. ''Justice Weekly'' has become a good reference for information about issues relating to crime and sexuality during the era it was published in large part due to its more comprehensive reporting on such topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image: Nuwest.jpg|right|thumb|175px|A typical spanking magazine.]] --&gt;
'''Spanking magazines''' are [[Pornography|pornographic]] periodicals which focus their content on photographs and stories depicting the [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] of [[erotic spanking]]. Spanking magazines came to prominence in the 1980s with titles like ''[[Janus (spnaking magazine)|Janus]]'' and ''[[Kane (magazine)|Kane]]'' edited by [[Harrison Marks]], ''[[Spank Hard!]]'' edited by [[Janice Gold]], ''[[Women of Nu-West]]'', and ''[[Nu-West's International Discipline Review]]'', both edited by [[Ed Lee]].

Most spanking magazines showcase series of photographs depicting a staged [[Domestic discipline|domestic]] [[spanking]] between two adult models (most frequently with the model shown receiving the spanking being a female, with the model shown giving the spanking being of either sex), with content filled in by fiction describing spanking scenarios frequently supplied by the magazines' readership. The model shown receiving the [[spanking]] often wears [[fantasywear]], like a [[Schoolgirl uniform fetish|schoolgirl]] or [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] uniform, to give the impression of youth.

Spanking magazines devoted to [[female dominance]] are also available, depicting men receiving spankings from women. ''[[Domination Directory International]]'', ''[[No-Nonsense Ladies (magazine)|No-Nonsense Ladies]],(from Scarlett Hill), ''[[Behind the Scene (magazine)|Behind the Scene]]'' (edited by [[Jennifer Brooks]]), ''[[Ma'am]]'' and ''[[The Ledagram]]'' (both edited by [[Ed Lee]]), and ''[[Whap! Magazine]]'' and ''[[Corporal (magazine)]] are examples of this genre.

While spanking magazines continue to be published on a limited basis, they have been supplanted in the 1990s by [[Internet]] sites that produce similar material more cheaply and more easily accessed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''fetish magazine''' is a type of [[magazine]] originating in the 1960s which is devoted to [[sexual fetishism]]. The content is generally aimed at being [[erotic]] rather than [[pornographic]].

'''''Smoke Signals''''', first published in 1993, is an online magazine devoted to [[smoking fetishism]].
 
As with many fetish-related business enterprises, Smoke Signals began as an outgrowth of the personal interest of its publisher. It is published ten times each year, with each issue including reviews of smoking fetish videos, tips on sexy smoking scenes in mainstream movies, photos, and reader contributions. While focusing initially on glamor smoking, i.e., attractive women smoking for the camera, in 1996 the magazine added a monthly &quot;dark side&quot; column devoted to female domination/SMBD aspects of the smoking fetish.

Beginning in 1993, Smoke Signals was published in a print edition mailed to a subscriber list; an on-line edition was added in the late 90's, with regular downloadable updates of photos and videoclips. As a result of declining subscriptions, the print edition was discontinued in mid-2006. The web edition, Smoke Signals Online, also includes extensive links on the smoking fetish.

'''''Bizarre''''' is a self-described &quot;alternative&quot; and &quot;non-mainstream&quot; magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;den&quot;&gt;[http://www.dennis.co.uk/Bizarre/IE_index.html Media Information] Dennis Publishing Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; It is a sister publication to ''[[Fortean Times]]''. It has no connection to the [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] publication also known as &quot;Bizarre&quot; published between 1946-1959.

The magazine has a wide variety of features and articles which include unusual news events from around the world, [[Hard and soft drugs|drug usage]], different types of fetishistic and [[deviant behavior]], interviews with famous [[counterculture]] figures and showcases of [[Cult following|cult]] directors, musicians and authors. Bizarre has also covered legislation regarding sex offences and civil liberties ([[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]], the fallout from [[Operation Spanner]], legislation banning &quot;[[extreme pornography]]&quot; and The [[Terrorism Act 2000]], for example ), along with issues issues like [[censorship]] and human rights abuses, both domestically and abroad. It has also started a campaign to raise awareness of prejudice towards subcultures following the murder of [[Sophie Lancaster]].

However, from the start the publication had much in common with more mainstream [[lad mag|lad's mags]], typically featuring a semi-nude female model on the front cover, gratuitous nude photography (overwhelmingly of women) in special sealed 'x rated' sections inside, and frequent reviews of weird gadgets, films, music, and websites. Though the gadgets in question are more likely to be items like [[switchblades|flickknives]], [[strap on]] dildos, [[whips]], [[drug paraphernalia]] and [[fetish clothing]], among other things. They also regularly cover [[outsider art]], [[queer culture]], the [[avant-garde]] and the [[Cinema of Transgression]] in their art and music reviews.

Bizarre was launched as a bimonthly title by [[John Brown Publishing]] in February 1997 and was edited by Fiona Jerome. It was an immediate success and changed to monthly issuance a year after its launch. Circulation peaked at over 120,000 in 2000 but has since declined.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In 2000 the title was sold to &quot;I Feel Good&quot; (IFG), a company founded by former [[Loaded (magazine)|Loaded]] editor James Brown (no relation to soul music icon [[James Brown]]), for approximately £5million. When IFG collapsed, Bizarre was acquired by [[Dennis Publishing]]. Its current editor is David McComb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Marquis''''' is a [[fetish magazine]] owned, operated, published and primarily photographed by [[Peter W. Czernich]] and Sandra Würdig. Based in Germany, Marquis covers a wide array of topics related to the worldwide [[fetish subculture]]. The magazine's name is a reference to the [[Marquis de Sade]].

Czernich's original publishing venture entitled ''[[«O»]]'' began as a spin-off of the British ''[[Skin Two]]'' magazine but quickly developed its own identity. After losing the right to the ''«O»'' name, Czernich created ''Marquis'' in 1994. It has continued to be published semiannually-to-quarterly ever since.

A spin-off title, ''[[Heavy Rubber]]'', began in 1996. Czernich has also developed a significant online presence including web versions of both magazines and a large online clothing &amp; book store.

Whereas it is true that the magazine's name derives from de Sade, the special interest addressed by the magazine is a poor match for the normal concept of &quot;sadism&quot; as casually understood by the layman. Marquis is very closely specialised on [[latex and PVC fetishism]] and related topics such as sexy girls in catsuits, advanced designs in bondage wear and other related fantasy scenarios.

The '''SIGNY awards''' were an annual series of awards that recognized the best performers, [[bondage artist|artist]]s, [[bondage photographer|photographer]]s and [[bondage rigger|riggers]], writers and [[bondage model|model]]s in the field of [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] [[erotica]].

The contest was annually held from 2000 to 2005, except in 2002, when the award was canceled halfway through the voting process. The 2001 awards were the result of more than 30,000 votes in each category. 

The website that hosted the SIGNY Awards has been removed from services since August 2006. Thus, there was no voting session nor awarding for 2006, nor for 2007.

In 2008, the Bondage Awards were created, with many of the same categories as before along with some new ones, including Best Product and Best Toystore.  

Unlike the SIGNY's, however, the new Bondage Awards didn't discriminate against many extreme bondage performers, companies and websites, which had previously been excluded from the SIGNY's even though they had received enough votes {{fact|date=January 2009}}.   Although there was some controversy in the final voting, for the first time, everyone was allowed to compete and have their votes count in the results.{{fact|date=January 2009}}

      <comment>/* Some films with hardcore inserts */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In the terminology of movie-making, a '''hardcore insert''' is an [[insert (film)|insert]], depicting vaginal or anal [[sexual penetration|penetration]] in a film. The technique was much in use in the 1970s, when [[adult film]]s were feature films that required women with acting abilities, at least for the lead roles. Many [[pornographic actor|actress]]es found it unacceptable to perform actual sex (or at least [[anal sex]]), so the inserts were shot with [[body double]]s. There was hardly a need for inserts in scenes of [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]] performed by actresses, because depiction of oral-genital contact was then considered &quot;semi-[[softcore]]&quot;. The practice also led to strange patterns. For example, some people believe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinebizarre.com/essay_forsa.htm Atomic Cinema: featured actress Marie Forsa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that one [[Sweden|Swedish]] actress, [[Marie Forså]], used to have actual sex, but then the penetration scenes would be removed from the cut and replaced with inserts.

==Some films with hardcore inserts==
* ''[[Thriller - en grym film]]'' (Thriller: A Cruel Picture) (1974) (vaginal and anal for [[Christina Lindberg]])
* ''[[Butterflies (1974 film)|Butterflies]]'' (1974) (vaginal for Marie Forså)
* ''[[Emanuelle nera]]'' ([[Black Emanuelle]]) (1975) (vaginal and oral for [[Laura Gemser]], vaginal and oral for [[Karin Schubert]])
* ''[[Le Sexe qui parle]]'' (Pussy Talk) (1975) (vaginal for Pénélope Lamour, anal for Ellen Earl)
* ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1976) (vaginal for [[Kristine DeBell]])
* ''[[Through the Looking Glass (film)|Through the Looking Glass]]'' (1976) (vaginal for [[Catherine Erhardt]])
* ''[[Je suis à prendre]]'' (Take Me) (1977) (anal for [[Brigitte Lahaie]])
* [[Emanuelle Around the World|''Emanuelle - Perché violenza alle donne?'']] ([[Emanuelle Around the World]]) (1977) (vaginal for [[Laura Gemser]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Wiki-sball.png|thumb|Illustration of a woman drooling [[semen]] into another woman's open mouth]]
__NOTOC__
'''Snowballing''' or '''semen swapping''' is a [[human]] [[sexual practice]] in which one partner takes into their mouth the [[semen]] of another person, and then 'swaps' or passes it to the mouth of another through [[kiss]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dalzell |first=Tom  |coauthors=Terry Victor (eds.)  |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC&amp;pg=PA1807 |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, Oxon |isbn=0-415-25938-X |pages=1807 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the increased amount of liquid content produced as the semen, and accompanying saliva, is transferred from one mouth to another, &quot;snowballing&quot; into a larger amount as the act goes on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14052 |title=Snowballing |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |last=Savage |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Savage |date=April 24, 2003 |publisher=[[Savage Love]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=August 2009|reason=Dan Savage is not a reliable source; he is very frequently misinformed about word orgins and spellings.}}

The term can refer to the man in a heterosexual couple ejaculating into the mouth of a woman, and then receiving his semen back from her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=2193 |title=Urine Love |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |last=Savage |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Savage |date=October 7, 1999 |publisher=[[Savage Love]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the [[homosexuality|homosexual]] context, a man may share the taste of semen by kissing or spitting the semen into another man's mouth before [[Seminophagia|swallowing]] it.

In a bisexual group-sex context, common in &quot;cumswap&quot; pornography, two or more female partners will share a man or several men's semen between themselves. Snowballing in this manner is often featured in [[pornography]] as part of a practice called [[bukkake]]. Here, men generally adopt the dominant role, and semen is passed between women's mouths. Instead of spitting out the semen, a much more common practice is that one woman reclines, opens her mouth, the other woman leans over her and lets the semen flow very slowly or trickle into the first woman's mouth; this process is slower and so it takes more time on video. Also, a clear distance is kept between their mouths in order to better see the actual fluid that is swapped. In most cases, the semen will then be swallowed by one or both of the actresses. Examples of pornographic film series which focus on the act include ''Sperm Swappers'' by [[Elegant Angel]],&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbiz.com/articles/82856 |title=Elegant Angel |accessdate=2009-04-11 |author=Hunter, Tod |date=2007-08-10 |work= |publisher=[[XBIZ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Cum In My Mouth I'll Spit Back In Yours'' from [[Devil's Film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devilsfilm.com devilsfilm.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because snowballing a man's semen involves the exchange of bodily fluids without any barrier, it is not a form of [[safer sex]]. Risks are similar to those of unprotected [[oral sex]].

==Use of the term in popular culture==
The term was popularized by [[Kevin Smith]]'s film, ''[[Clerks]],'' in which the character of [[Willam Black]] is nicknamed &quot;Snowball&quot; because he enjoys the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke |first=David |title=The Slangman Guide to Dirty English |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tY455JR5e2QC&amp;pg=PA183 |accessdate=December 7, 2008 |year=2003 |publisher=Slangman Publishing |location=Studio City, Calif. |isbn=1891888-234 |pages=183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was additionally noted in the film ''[[Stepmom (film)|Stepmom]]'', when [[Julia Roberts]] is talking to her stepdaughter about bullying. The term was then misrepresented (called &quot;snow blowing&quot;) by the mother while having a talk with her children's stepmother.
 
The term is also generally referred to as a ''cum swap'' or ''mouth to mouth'' within pornographic films.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''stunt cock''' is the term for a well-endowed penis that is used during the shooting of [[pornographic film]]s.

The stunt cock is used in an extreme close up so as not to identify its bearer, the goal being to deceive the viewer into thinking that the stunt cock is actually the penis of the main actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|coauthors=Dalzell, Tom; Victor, Terry|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|volume=2|pages=1895|isbn=0-415-25938-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC&amp;pg=PA1895&amp;dq=%22stunt+cock%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U3kndOVecF8VXf63uvjyq4AdATP1w|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Cassell's Dictionary of Slang|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|location=125 Strand, London WC2R 0BB|year=2005|edition=Second|pages=1385|isbn=0 304 366366|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5GpLcC4a5fAC&amp;pg=PA1385&amp;dq=%22stunt+cock%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U3H9rnKuS_LsjVEWYyTGkXdNWODwg|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a stunt cock is analogous to a &quot;[[stunt man]],&quot; who anonymously does dangerous live action sequences in place of the main actor. 

However, a stunt cock seldom performs dangerous acts on film. Though the term draws its name from this term, its practical application is more analogous to a [[body double]].

==Industry role==

Stunt cock work is a very common &quot;workhorse&quot; position in the pornography industry. The majority of prominent male pornographic actors have worked in this capacity at least once. Some actors work as stunt cocks specifically out of a desire for anonymity.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

Work on a pornographic film can be very demanding, and it is often difficult for actors to perform on demand as needed. A common function of a stunt cock is to stand in for an actor who is unable to achieve erection or ejaculation or an actor who has a penis of a relatively small size, so that filming can continue on schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Editorial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/exclusives/xero/xero4.html|title= How to shoot a 'live' adult video|last=Xero|first=Xanadu |publisher=The Raw Story|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, a stunt cock might also stand in for an actor whose penis is considered too small or otherwise undesirable by the director.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

*In the 1998 [[Trey Parker]] film ''[[Orgazmo]]'', the protagonist's director assigns him a stunt cock, as he doesn't want to actually participate in the sexual scenes.
*In the sixth book of ''[[The Dresden Files]]'', ''[[Blood Rites (novel)|Blood Rites]]'', Harry investigates a pornographic film crew and is mistaken for a stunt cock by one of the actors.
*A stunt cock is used in the TV Show ''[[Californication]]'' to complete the filming of &quot;Vagina Town&quot; when the lead actor is hung over.

A '''pearl necklace''' is a [[sexual slang|slang]] term referring to a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] act in which a man [[ejaculates]] [[semen]] on or near the [[neck]], [[chest]] or [[breast]] of another [[person]]. It can be done following [[mammary intercourse]] or [[oral sex]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;davis&quot;&gt;Davis, 1996, pages 125-127&lt;/ref&gt;  The result is said by some to look like a [[necklace]] of [[pearl]]s because of the stringy [[translucent]] white drops of semen that are deposited there.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0060392320 Sex Tips for Straight Women from a Gay Man]'': Dan Anderson. [[Regan Books]], 1997. p106-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0446692816?v=search-inside&amp;keywords=%22Pearl%20necklace%22%20sex The Vice Guide to Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll]'': Suroosh Alvi, Gavin McInnes, Shane Smith. [[Warner Books]], 2003. p35&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alternative slang terms also exist: ''piss in the dugout'' and ''jizz spider''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/piss%20in%20the%20dugout Sex-Lexis: piss in the dugout]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/jizz%20spider Sex-Lexis: jizz spider]&lt;/ref&gt;

It's one of the activities that prostitutes use as [[safe sex]] alternatives for clients who refuse to wear a [[condom]], because [[mammary intercourse]] on big breasted women feels like penetrative sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Intimate Details &amp; Vital Statistics: AIDS, Sexuality and the Social Order in New Zealand |author = Peter Davis | editor = [[Auckland University Press]] | year = 1996 | pages = 125-127 | isbn = 1869401395 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Ww17hRdmDi8C&amp;pg=PA127&amp;vq=pearl+necklace&amp;dq=%22pearl+necklace%22+sexual&amp;lr=&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;pearl necklace&quot; is a topic that has appeared in popular culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ass-to-mouth''' is a [[colloquial]] term for the removal of the [[penis]] from the passive partner's [[anus]] followed by the immediate insertion of the penis into the passive partner's or another partner's [[mouth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UTexas&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/%7Erjensen/freelance/justajohn.pdf | author=Robert Jensen, Ph.D. | format=PDF | publisher=The University of Texas at Austin | title=Just a John | accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Alternate terminology ==
It is also known as '''A2M''', '''ATM''', or '''Ass-to-Mouth'''. Ass-to-mouth generally excludes cleaning the penis or other object after its removal from the anus and before its insertion into the mouth. This may enhance sexual excitement for both active and passive partners, often developing from connotations of domination/humiliation. '''Ass-to-other mouth''', abbreviated as '''A2OM''' or '''ATOM''', specifically describes the variant of the act where the penis is moved from one partner's anus to a different partner's mouth. Another variation is known as '''A2P''', '''ATP''', or '''Ass-to-Pussy''' which refers to removing the penis from the anus and inserting it into the vagina. The term has been used since at least January 1995 and clearly defined since at least August 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossary&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sex-work.org/pages/clients_corner/definitions.htm | publisher=Sex-work.org | title=Definitions | accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its health risks, ass-to-mouth has become prevalent in pornographic films, depicting it as a pleasurable act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiny Nibbles&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tinynibbles.com/realpornsex.html | publisher=Tiny Nibbles | title=Real porn | accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Love and Health&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://loveandhealth.ifriends.net/ArchiveClassificationDescriptions.cfm | title=Ass to Mouth | publisher=Love and Health | accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==
The health risks of ass-to-mouth include the risks of both [[oral sex]] and [[anal-oral sex]]. Unprotected oral-genital contact involves the risk of contracting [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, such as [[genital herpes]] or [[chlamydia]] and [[HIV]]. HIV can be transmitted due to the fact that rough anal sex, usually results in minuscule tearing of the rectal tissue, and small amounts of blood are left on the penis. When another partner sucks the penis, if they have a tiny sore, tear or cut in their mouth, they can get infected with HIV. The recipient of ass-to-mouth is also at risk of infection by [[Hepatitis A]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7625417&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus|&quot;A community-wide outbreak of hepatitis A: risk factors for infection among homosexual and bisexual men.&quot;], US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Epidemiology Program Office, PMID: 7625417&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[intestinal parasite]]s and other diseases carried in the feces.

Some of the commonly transmitted diseases are gastroenteritis and enterocolitis, which are acute infections of the stomach, small intestine and/or large intestine, by gut flora organisms such as [[E. coli]], [[Campylobacter]], [[Shigella]], [[Salmonella]], or [[Yersinia]], causing fever, vomiting, and diarrhea lasting for several days. Most other sexually transmitted bacterial diseases, like syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, can be transmitted by anal-oral contact. Viral diseases including herpes, cytomegalovirus, and human papillomavirus (the virus that causes cervical cancer and genital warts, as well as oral or laryngeal papillomas and carcinomas) can also be transmitted by this route.

It is unknown whether thoroughly washing the anal area and applying an [[enema]] results in reduced risk of disease, although general cleanliness is advisable for any sexual act. &lt;!-- And this says what can be done to reduce the risk, and that we don't know if it works. --&gt;
Porn-industry performers often use enemas prior to filming anal sex sequences; however, this is primarily to eliminate the possibility of any fecal matter appearing on film, rather than disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Savage]], [http://www.portlandmercury.com/columns/savage-love/Content?oid=29323 Savage Love] column, ''The Portland Mercury'' (2003-07-03). Quoting Ben Scuglia, editor of ''Inside Porn'' magazine: &quot;[The performers] clear the pipes with a nice, relaxing douche.... Porn buttholes are so clean-clean-clean you could eat off them. Porn is all about squeaky-clean fantasy; even the 'dirty' stuff is supervised and choreographed.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fluffer''' is a hired member of the crew of a [[pornographic movie]] whose role on the set is to sexually arouse the male participants prior to the filming of scenes requiring [[erection]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;latenv&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/emmys/env-et-channel28aug28,0,2703208.story?track=mostviewed-splashpage|title=Long night for Emmys|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2006-08-27|accessdate=2008-05-10|first=Scott|last=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many adult film stars{{Who|date=July 2008}} maintain that fluffers are a thing of the past, needed in the 1970s and 1980s when the crew, shooting on [[celluloid]], needed much more time to prepare a shot. [[Erectile dysfunction]] drugs such as [[Viagra]] have also played a part in replacing fluffers.
 
A fluffer also has the duty of keeping adult film stars &quot;cleaned up&quot; in between takes or during photo shoot set-ups, so that the actors or models do not have to move from their positions. These duties are considered part of the makeup department. After setting up the desired angle, the director asks the actors to hold position and calls for the fluffer to &quot;fluff&quot; the actors for the shot.

There have been two films entitled ''[[The Fluffer]]''. The first,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E1DC173BF935A25752C1A9679C8B63|title=FILM REVIEW; O.K., Just Tell Your Folks It's Artistic Work, in Films|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2001-11-16|accessdate=2008-05-10|first=A.O|last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2001 release, was about a [[bisexual]] man with a crush on a gay porn star that is [[heterosexual]] [[gay for pay|outside of his video career]].

The '''centerfold''' of a [[magazine]] refers to a [[gatefold]]ed [[Spread (typography)|spread]], usually a [[portrait]] such as a [[pin-up]] or a [[nude]], inserted in the middle of the publication, or to the model featured in the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/centerfold Definition of &quot;centerfold&quot;] from the [[Merriam-Webster]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[saddle-stitch]]ed magazines (as opposed to those that are [[perfect binding|perfect-bound]]), the centerfold does not have any blank space cutting through the image.

The term was coined by [[Hugh Hefner]], founder of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/hefner/profile.html |title=People in the News: Hugh Hefner Profile |accessdate=2008-07-21 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of the first issue of ''Playboy'' has been attributed in large part to its centerfold: a nude of [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-04-21 | format = FAQ
| work = World of Playboy | publisher = playboy.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of monthly centerfolds gave the pin-up a new respectability, and helped to sanitize the notion of &quot;sexiness&quot;.&lt;ref name=Slade/&gt; Being featured as a centerfold could lead to film roles for models, and still occasionally does today.&lt;ref name=Slade&gt;{{cite book|title=Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|author=Slade, Joseph W. |year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZaGTZySRzeYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0313315205|pages=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, Hefner required ''Playboy'' centerfolds to be portrayed in a very specific way, telling photographers in a [[1956]] memo that the &quot;model must be in a natural setting engaged in some activity 'like reading, writing, mixing a drink'...[and]... should have a 'healthy, intelligent, American look&amp;mdash;a young lady that looks like she might be a very efficient secretary or an undergrad at [[Vassar College|Vassar]].'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nplus1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nplusonemag.com/playboy-hugh-hefner-story| title=Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story| publisher=''[[n+1]]''|date=January 13, 2009| accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hefner later said that the ideal centerfold is one in which &quot;a situation is suggested, the presence of someone not in the picture&quot;; the goal was to transform &quot;a straight [[pinup]] into an intimate interlude, something personal and special.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nplus1&quot;/&gt;

Though the term has become linked in the public consciousness with erotic material or models, many other magazines such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[National Geographic]]'' have published fold-out spreads on other subjects.

'''Deep-throating''' is an act in which a man's entire erect [[penis]] is inserted deep into the mouth of a woman or man, in such a way as to enter the receiving partner's throat.&lt;ref&gt;Totem and Taboo. Sigmund Freud. New York: Random House, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often part of [[fellatio]]. The term was popularized by the 1972 film ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}  It may be difficult for some persons to learn, however, due to the requirement of suppressing the natural gag reflex.  Cupping the scrotum also enhances the deep throat experience.

A '''facial''' (also '''facial cumshot''' or '''cum facial''') is a term for the [[sexual activity]] in which one person [[ejaculation|ejaculates]] [[semen]] onto the [[face]] of one or more [[sexual partners]].

A facial is a form of [[non-penetrative sex]], though it is generally performed after some other means of [[sexual stimulation]], such as [[anal sex]], [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]], [[masturbation]], or [[oral sex]]. Facial [[cumshot]]s are regularly depicted in [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Japan]]ese [[pornographic]] media, often as a way to close a scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==
The performance of a facial is typically preceded by activity that results in the [[sexual arousal]] and stimulation of the [[ejaculating]] participant. After the prerequisite level of [[sexual stimulation]] has been achieved, and ejaculation becomes imminent, the male will position his [[penis]] so that the semen that is discharged will be deposited onto his partner's face.

The volume of semen that is ejaculated depends on several factors, including the male's health, age, degree of sexual excitement, and the time since his last ejaculation.&lt;ref name=&quot;focus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.focusonfertility.org/resource_swimming_conception.htm  | title=Swimming Toward Conception: The Semen Analysis | publisher=Focus on Fertility, American Infertility Association and Organon Pharmaceuticals USA Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normal quantities of ejaculate range from 1.5 to 5.0 [[milliliter]]s (1 [[teaspoon]]). Seconds after being deposited onto the face, the semen thickens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep021223.pdf| title=Semen Displacment as s Sperm Competition Strategy in Humans| publisher=Evolutionary Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; before liquefying 15-30 minutes later.

==Prevalence in pornography==
[[File:Semfac01.png|thumb|An illustration of a man ejaculating onto a woman's face]]
Facial cumshots are regularly portrayed in pornographic films, videos, magazines and internet web sites. In addition to mainstream pornography, the popularity of facials has led to creation of its own niche market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avn.com/internet/articles/3374.html|title=The Final (Niche) Frontier|publisher=AVN Online |accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo Ohira, director of marketing for Silvercash, [[Rhetorical question|rhetorically]] asks &quot;Who doesn't like spewing their [[semen|load]] on a pretty young face?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avn.com/video/articles/23956.html|title=Silvercash Releases New Solo-Girl, Tranny and Facial Sites|publisher=AVN Online |accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adult entertainment industry has responded to consumer demand for facial oriented material by producing such video series that specialise in showing the act. [[Vivid Entertainment|Vivid Entertainment's]] national sales manager Howard Levine in a press release for an adult film described the movie as &quot;It's &lt;nowiki&gt;[her]&lt;/nowiki&gt; first movie ever, it's got high production value and lots of facials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avn.com/video/articles/23939.html|title=Vivid to Ship Sunny|publisher=AVN Online |accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the internet, many sites specialize in offering this content to the market. Internet based content is distributed in the form of picture galleries and videos made available as downloads or streaming content. Content is distributed freely or by means of subscription based services.

Predating the modern age of pornography, facials were also described in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat [[Marquis de Sade]] wrote about performing facials in his work [[The 120 Days of Sodom|''The 120 Days of Sodom'']], written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads &quot;... I show them my prick, then what do you suppose I do? I squirt the fuck in their face... That's my passion my child, I have no other... and you're about to behold it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Content analysis]] of best-selling heterosexual pornographic videos has shown that over 96% of all scenes concluded with a male performer ejaculating onto the body of his female partner. The mouth was the most common area to be ejaculated upon. When all regions of the face are included, facial cum shots comprise approximately 62% of scenes where external ejaculation occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/0/5/2/pages170523/p170523-1.php | title=Aggression and Sexual Behavior in Best-Selling Pornography |publisher=AllAcademic Research |accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 interview with [[Martin Amis]], [[pornographic actress]] [[Temptress (pornographic actress)|Temptress]] revealed a trick which is used when male actors are unable to ejaculate; &quot;You get some [[pina colada]] mix. The cock's in your mouth and you let it, like, ooze out around it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Amis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4153718,00.html |title=A rough trade |accessdate=2009-04-10 |author=[[Martin Amis]] |date=2001-03-17 |publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural perceptions==
===In pornography===
The emotional, psychological, and sociological significance of the depiction of facials in pornographic media is a source of controversy, with no consensus being reached. There are a variety of views ranging from facials being an act of [[misogyny]], degradation, or [[humiliation]] to being a healthy expression of human sexuality.

[[Feminist]] critiques of the depiction of facials are primarily critical. [[Sociology|Sociologists]] Gail Dines, Robert Jensen and Russo echo these sentiments in the book ''Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality'' it asserts &quot;In pornography, ejaculating onto a woman is a primary method by which she is turned into a [[slut]], something (not really someone) whose primary, if not only, purpose is to be sexual with men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dines | first = G | coauthors = Jensen R; Russo A  | title = Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality  | publisher = Routledge  | origdate = 1997  | pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=0i7dw9CwUe4C&amp;pg=PA78 78]  | isbn = 978-0415918121  | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Linda Williams (film critic)|Linda Williams]] concludes that facials are a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] or a perversion. She states &quot;The money shot is thus an obvious perversion -in the literal sense of the term, as a swerving away from more &quot;direct&quot; forms of genital engagement- of the tactile sexual connection.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;/&gt;  [[Anti-pornography]] activist [[Andrea Dworkin]] stated at a conference at the University of Chicago, &quot;It is a convention of pornography that the sperm is on her, not in her. It marks the spot, what he owns and how he owns it. The ejaculation that is on her is a way of saying (through showing) that she is contaminated with his dirt; that she is dirty.&quot;

Other critics suggest different meanings.  Author Lisa Moore suggests that Dworkin's explanation does not take into account that it is the pleasure the actresses exhibit that the male partners enjoy, and that it is more accurate to think men want their semen to be wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Moore  | first = LJ  | title = Sperm Counts: Overcome by Man's Most Precious Fluid  | publisher = [[New York University Press]]  | pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=tpiyGxq92RwC&amp;pg=PA84 84]  | isbn = 978-0814757185  | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women's activist [[Beatrice Faust]] stated &quot;Since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism.&quot; She goes on to say &quot;Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Faust, Beatrice |title=Women, sex, and pornography: a controversial and unique study |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1980 |pages= |isbn=0-02-537050-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slade&gt;{{cite book  | last = Slade  | first = Joseph W.  | title = Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide Vol. 2   | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]  | origdate = 2001  | pages=656  | isbn = 0-313-31520-5  | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex columnist]] Nina Anthony also views the practice of facials in a non-threatening light, feeling that it adds variety to the sexual experience. In one of her weekly articles she wrote &quot;But let's give credit where credit is due: The money shot, by itself, is great for a number of reasons. Blowing it on someone's face is like a change-up pitch - if you've been throwing the heat for a while, maybe you should consider hooking the curve ball.&quot; She continues with &quot;Also, being on the receiving end of the shot can satisfy the secret porn star in everyone and it's minor kink for beginners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=10435|title=Ejaculate Maturely: A Little Man Cream Never Went This Far|publisher=Daily Nexus |accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joseph Slade, author and professor at [[Ohio University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcomschool.ohiou.edu/faculty/slade.html|title=Ohio University Faculty |accessdate=2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote of her work that &quot;Williams thinks of ejaculation as a [[leitmotif]] similar to those that punctuate musical comedy, a genre she thinks resembles the hard-core film. Although Williams' thesis tends to reduce porn films to a single heterosexual genre, ''Hard Core'' is remarkable because the author actually engages the subject instead of pontificating from distance and because she insists that feminists must learn to reevaluate sexual expression.&quot;&lt;ref name=slade/&gt;

In her essay &quot;Speaking Out: Teaching In&quot; Cindy Patton simply reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Fuss  | first = Diana  | title = Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories   | publisher = Routledge  | origdate = 1991-09-01  | pages= http://books.google.ca/books?id=0cbuW1iQVIwC&amp;pg=PA373 373–386]  | isbn = 978-0415902373  | year = 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slade/&gt;

===In society===
The frequency at which facials are performed amongst the general public is unknown, as no academic sexual survey has addressed the subject. It is generally thought that it is performed far less frequently than it is practiced in pornography.&lt;ref name=slade/&gt; This is based on the assumption of other sexual activity portrayed in pornography versus society at large. As an example, anal sex is nearly [[Omnipresence|ubiquitous]] in modern heterosexual pornography, but performed regularly by only about 10% of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad362.pdf] 2006 survey of sexual behavior from the CDC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Healthy sex is all in the talk |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=[[2005-05-05]] |url=http://www.straight.com/article/healthy-sex-is-all-in-the-talk |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==
===Transmission of disease===
Any sexual activity that involves contact with the [[bodily fluids]] of another person contains the risk of transmission of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Mann  | first = Thaddeus  | title = Male Reproductive Function and Semen  | publisher = Springer  | origdate = 1981  | pages=  | isbn = 978-0387103839  | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scheit  | first = Karl H.  | title = Proteins of Seminal Plasma  | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons  | origdate = 1990  | pages=  | isbn = 978-0471846857  | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis]]. The [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] categorizes semen as &quot;other potentially infectious material&quot; or OPIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   |url= http://www.dir.ca.gov/DOSH/AdultFilmIndustry.html#hh  |title= Cal/OSHA Health Hazards in the Adult Film Industry  |accessdate=2008-07-25   |publisher=State of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from other sexual activity that may have occurred prior to performing a facial the risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner there is almost no risk of contracting an STD. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher.&lt;ref name = Moore/&gt; Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive [[mucus membranes]] (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.

The research paper ''The Adult Film Industry: Time to Regulate?'' co-authored by the [[Los Angeles County Department of Health Services]] and [[UCLA]] noted &quot;All the more concerning, high-risk practices are on the rise. These practices include sex acts that involve simultaneous [[double penetration]] (double-anal and vaginal-anal intercourse) and repeated facial ejaculations.&quot;

The authors make recommendations for eliminating the risk of performing facials by suggesting &quot;Facial ejaculations could be simulated through the use of inert materials such as liquid antacids combined with filming techniques, which would eliminate any health risk to the performer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url= http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040126&amp;ct=1

  |accessdate=2008-07-25
  |publisher=PLoS Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry publication [[AVN (magazine)|AVN Magazine]] scoffs at such suggestions. Considering the idea of simulating facials to be ridiculous, writing &quot;Simply put, the viewing public isn't that easily fooled - and it wants its facials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2008-07-25
  |publisher=AVN Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergic reactions===
In rare cases, people have been known to experience allergic reactions to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma [[hypersensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guillet G, Dagregorio G, Guillet M | title = [Vulvar contact dermatitis due to seminal allergy: 3 cases] | journal = Ann Dermatol Venereol | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15798560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include [[hives]] and even difficulty breathing.

Mild cases of semen [[allergy]] can often be overcome by repeated exposure to seminal fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weidinger S, Ring J, Köhn F | title = IgE-mediated allergy against human seminal plasma. | journal = Chem Immunol Allergy | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 128–38 | year = | pmid = 16129942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Felching''' is a [[Human sexual behavior|sexual practice]] involving the licking or sucking of another person's anus. This practice involves a high health risk. In particular, it refers to the act of sucking [[semen]] out of the [[anus]] of one's partner.  The semen has been ejaculated into the [[rectum]] via [[anal sex]]. The act of sucking the semen and then passing it, through mouth-to-mouth or open-mouth kissing, is often referred to as &quot;[[Snowballing (sexual practice)|snowballing]]&quot;; although the latter is typically associated with semen ejaculated into a mouth from [[fellatio]].

Felching may also refer to the anal insertion of a small animal (usually a [[gerbil]]) for the purpose of sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00316740?query_type=advsearch&amp;queryword=felch&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;search_spec=simple%3Afulltext&amp;order=ab&amp;return_set=entries&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=2&amp;control_no=00316740&amp;search_id=4fMp-cA0Ha3-3019&amp;side=M &quot;felch&quot; in ''The Oxford English Dictionary''], Mar. 2003 draft entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest appearance of the term==

According to the 2003 draft entry for &quot;felch&quot; in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the earliest occurrence of the word in print appears to have been in ''The Argot of the Homosexual Subculture'' by Ronald A. Farrell in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{bquote|FELTCH [sic] (v.): To use one's mouth or tongue on the anus of his partner; anilingus or male cunnilingus (syn. RIM).}}

The word was subsequently used in the work of [[Zap Comix]] underground cartoonists, [[Robert Crumb]], [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Spain Rodriguez|&quot;Spain&quot; Rodriguez]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] in 1975. The Zap collective published two sexually themed comic books, ''Snatch'' and ''Jiz'' and decided to continue pushing the envelope by publishing a book named ''Felch''. According to Williams:

{{bquote|OK, since we didn’t get in any trouble with Snatch and Jiz, and a couple of these other comics, I was partying one night with Crumb, Wilson and these other guys. And Wilson mentioned to me, he says, &quot;I was talking to Ken Weaver and he had this real interesting word.&quot; I said what, &quot;what it?&quot; A word called &quot;felch.&quot; I said, &quot;what does that mean?&quot; He said, &quot;it is a real old term and it means orally withdrawing semen from someone’s lower digestive tract after having anal sex.&quot; I said, &quot;there’s a word for something like that?&quot; That’s incredible that not only is there a word like that, but it has a provenance. Hell yeah, we’re going to do a felch comic. So I talked to Crumb, &quot;yeah we’re going to do a felch comic.&quot;}}

Crumb's contribution was a parody of an [[editorial cartoon]] featuring [[John Q. Public]] felching &quot;[[Mother Nature]]/[[Lady Liberty]]&quot; after she has had anal sex with a [[Pravda]]-style cartoon capitalist.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Crumb: ''The Complete Crumb Comics, Volume 10''. Fantagraphics Books, 1993. ISBN 1-56097137-1. Reproduction of cartoon from &quot;Felch Cumix&quot; 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams produced a felching themed solo work in 1975 titled ''The Nectar of Satan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;englishdotufldotedu-imagetext-archive-williams&quot;&gt;

The term is used for comedic effect in the 1994 film [[Dumb and Dumber]], when one of the two lead characters tells the other of an old girlfriend, whom the latter suddenly remembers as &quot;Freda Felcher from Cranston.&quot;

Felching was later mentioned and popularized by the 2000 [[Chuck Palahniuk]] book &quot;Invisible Monsters&quot;, 2004 [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] film ''[[A Dirty Shame]]'', and [[Eminem|Eminem's]] song &quot;Insane&quot; from his 2009 album ''[[Relapse (album)|Relapse]]'', in which Eminem asks if you would rather get felched or do the felching.

A '''cum shot''', '''cumshot'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Come}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''come shot''',&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/17/money_shot_intro.html Extract] of ''The Money Shot'' by Jane Mills.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatal Advice: How Safe-Sex Education Went Wrong|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|author=Cindy Patton |year=1996|url=http://www.questiaschool.com/read/1067656|isbn=|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''pop shot''', or '''[[money shot]]''' is the record (on film or video or, less frequently, in some [[pornographic magazines]]) of a man [[ejaculate|ejaculating]], usually onto a person or object. It is typically the [[cinematographer]]'s indication, within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, that the sexual act recorded is authentic and has concluded for the male participant.

Some feminist critics have argued that the depiction of cum shots are an expression of [[misogyny]] and [[objectification]] of women, when they are performed with a female partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Review&quot;&gt;[http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/review_pornocopia_laurence_otoole_review.htm Review] by Padraig McGrath.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist writer [[Susan Faludi]] argues that pornography scenes depicting women performing oral sex on men objectify the ''male'' performer, in that the male performer's entire body, except for the erect penis, is off-camera.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masthead&quot;&gt;[http://www.masthead.net.au/issue9/son1.html Masthead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, [[sexologist]] Peter Sándor Gardos argues that the men who enjoy viewing these scenes are the men &quot;who have positive attitudes toward women.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nearbycafe.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nearbycafe.com/loveandlust/steinberg/erotic/cn/cn2.html Bruce Herschensohn; Bill Clinton; Sexologists in San Diego; Future Sex 2] by Bruce Herschensohn.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origin of related term &quot;money shot&quot; ==
The &quot;cum shot&quot; is often referred to as ''the money shot'' in a borrowing from mainstream feature filmmakers, who used the term &quot;money shot&quot; as slang for the image that cost the most money to produce;&lt;ref name=Mills/&gt; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence would become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of a dam bursting might be called the &quot;money shot&quot; of the film.

The pornography industry adopted the term &quot;'money shot'&quot; because the final ejaculation scene has become an important element in pornographic depictions, in part because it proves to the viewer that they have witnessed an authentic sexual act.

The &quot;cum shot&quot; has become such a common conclusion to scenes in [[pornographic movie]]s that if a scene does not end with an ejaculation sequence, viewers may believe that the actor was unable to climax or that the scene was cut. According to Stephen Ziplow, author of ''The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography '', &quot;...the come shot, or, as some refer to it, 'the money shot', is the most important element in the movie and that everything else (if necessary) should be sacrificed at its expense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mills, ''The Money Shot: Cinema, Sin and Censorship''. Pluto Press, Annandale 2001. ISBN 1 86403 142 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pornography and erotica without &quot;cum shots&quot; ==
Two exceptions to this expectation are [[softcore pornography]], in which penetration is not explicitly shown and &quot;couples [[erotica]]&quot;, which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material, and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation.

Cum shots technically do not appear in &quot;[[Lesbianism in erotica|girl-girl]]&quot; scenes as far as the expulsion of semen goes, and orgasm is normally implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement. Although [[lesbian]] porn may not show the expulsion of semen, [[female ejaculation]] may be present.

== Other meanings ==
While the term &quot;cum shot&quot; normally refers to filming of the ejaculation scene in a pornographic movie (the term &quot;shot&quot; in &quot;cum shot&quot; refers to the filming, or &quot;shooting&quot; of the scene), the term is also used more loosely to refer to the actual physiological event of male ejaculation.

== Feminist perceptions ==
===Arguments===
[[File:Wiki-facial.png|thumb|An illustration of a man ejaculating onto a woman's face]]
It is common for a [[fellatio]]/[[irrumatio]] scene in pornography to end with the actor ejaculating onto the actress's face. Some have interpreted that as an expression of [[misogyny]], [[male domination]] and [[objectification]] of women.

For example, in Padraig McGrath's review of Laurence O'Toole's book ''Pornocopia – Porn, Sex, Technology and Desire'', he rhetorically asks whether &quot;...women enjoy having men ejaculate on their faces?&quot; He suggests that the role of a &quot;cum shot&quot; scene such as this is to suggest that &quot;...it doesn’t matter what the woman likes – she’ll like whatever the man wants her to like because she has no inner life of her own, in turn because she’s not a real person.&quot; McGrath argues that there is a &quot;power-aspect&quot; to depictions such as &quot;come shots.&quot; 

He alleges that the &quot;...central theme [of pornography] is power...[,] implicitly violent...eroticized hatred.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Review&quot;/&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist and the [[author]] of ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argues that pornography scenes depicting women performing oral sex on men objectify the ''male'' performer, in that the male performer's entire body, except for the erect penis, is off-camera. In the article &quot;My Son's Penis&quot; from ''Masthead'' magazine, Richard Jeffrey Newman, who cites Faludi, claims that &quot;the male performer's [in porn] primary function is to make her [the female actress'] performance possible. He is her straight man, her foil, or as Susan Faludi puts it in her essay &quot;The Money Shot&quot; her &quot;appendage, the object of the object.&quot;&quot; 

The author of the Masthead article claims that the woman in such a scene may appear like a &quot;machine&quot;. She states that during a scene depicting a &quot;white woman's mouth in the act of swallowing a white man's penis ...the shape of his organ glides back and forth against the inside of her left cheek...[with] her lips engulfing and expelling his genitals as if she were the only movable part of a well-oiled machine.&quot; The author claims that the &quot;cum-shot is supposed to represent the pinnacle and proof of male heterosexual pleasure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Masthead&quot;/&gt; 

The author of the &quot;My Son's Penis&quot; article states that with &quot;the cum shot, the pleasure of which is expressed not in what the man on the screen felt in his own body up to and including the point of his ejaculation, but rather in what it means for him to ejaculate onto the body of a woman.&quot; She claims that the way cum shots are depicted in pornography is a &quot;more or less absolute yoking in heterosexual pornography of male sexual pleasure to a woman's presence.&quot; She argues that focus on having the man ejaculate onto a woman &quot;... has a moral fervor, an intellectual certainty&quot; that is usually associated with &quot;religious or scientific pronouncements.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Masthead&quot;/&gt;

Another critic of &quot;cum shot&quot; scenes in pornography is the US porn star-turned writer, director and producer [[Candida Royalle]]. She produced pornography films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the &quot;misogynous predictability&quot; and depiction of sex in &quot;...as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible.&quot; Royalle also criticizes the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates. Royalle’s films are not “goal oriented” towards a final &quot;cum shot&quot;; instead, her films depict sexual activity within the broader context of women's emotional and social lives.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/15/1087244912619.html Girls on top]&quot; by Lilly Bragge, ''[[The Age]]'', [[June 16]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterarguments===
In contrast, sexologist Peter Sándor Gardos argues that his research suggests that &quot;... the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women.&quot; (on the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in 1992).&lt;ref name=&quot;nearbycafe.com&quot;/&gt; Later, on The [[World Pornography Conference]] in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that &quot;no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. Harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=Labash&gt;[http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/voicebox/MenOnPorn/Labash_excerpt.asp Excerpt] from &quot;Among the Pornographers,&quot; Matt Labash's coverage of the 1998 World Pornography Conference for ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Lisa Moore suggests that it is the pleasure the actresses exhibit that the male partners enjoy, and that it is more accurate to think men want their semen to be wanted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Moore  | first = LJ  | title = Sperm Counts: Overcome by Man's Most Precious Fluid  | publisher = [[New York University Press]]  | pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=tpiyGxq92RwC&amp;pg=PA84 84]  | isbn = 978-0814757185  | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's activist [[Beatrice Faust]] stated &quot;Since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism.&quot; She goes on to say &quot;Logically, if sex is natural and wholesome and semen is as healthy as sweat, there is no reason to interpret ejaculation as a hostile gesture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Faust, Beatrice |title=Women, sex, and pornography: a controversial and unique study |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1980 |pages= |isbn=0-02-537050-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slade&gt;{{cite book  | last = Slade  | first = Joseph W.  | title = Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide Vol. 2   | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]  | origdate = 2001  | pages=656  | isbn = 0-313-31520-5  | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also people involved in the porn industry differ in their opinions on the topic. Thus, Bill Margold, who has starred in over 400 films, has stated that cum shots represent &quot;vicarious revenge exacted upon the cheerleader by X-number of men who could not get that cheerleader.&quot;&lt;ref name=Labash/&gt;

A '''gang bang''' (or '''gangbang''') is a situation in which a person has [[sexual intercourse]] with multiple partners in turn or at the same time.

==Term==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}
A gang bang typically is a form of group sex where a person has sexual relations with three or more partners and is not to be confused with a [[threesome]]. Gang bangs vary in activity, but most gang bangs include [[sexual intercourse]], [[oral sex]], and [[masturbation]] performed on a person. 

In many [[heterosexual]] gang bangs, vaginal intercourse and anal sex are combined, and performed on a woman by two men simultaneously. This activity is called [[List of sex positions#Multiple_penetration|double penetration]], and is sometimes accompanied by the woman giving a third man a [[fellatio|blow job]]. 

In the case of all-male participants, the activity of double penetration takes on a different meaning: typically, it includes two men penetrating and performing anal sex on another man at the same time. This also is sometimes accompanied by the [[top and bottom (slang)|bottom]] giving a third man a [[fellatio|blow job]] or by mutual oral services of other men present and waiting their turn to penetrate the designated bottom.

== Gang bang pornography ==
{{main|Gang bang pornography}}
Though there have been numerous gang bang [[pornographic film]]s since the 1980s, they usually involve no more than half a dozen to a dozen men. But starting with ''[[The World's Biggest Gangbang]]'' (1995), starring [[Annabel Chong]], the [[pornography|pornographic]] industry began producing a series of films ostensibly setting gang bang records for most consecutive sex acts by one person in a short period. &lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/1999/08/31/houston | title = The gang's all here (Hope flickers at the World's Biggest Gangbang) | first = K. | last = Bisch | publisher = [[Salon Magazine]] | date = 1999-08-31 | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The films were financially successful, winning [[AVN Awards]] for the best selling pornographic films of their year; however the events were effectively un-officiated and the record breaking claims often misleading.&lt;ref name=VillageVoice&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/people/0003,taormino,11859,24.html | title = The ABCs of Porn | authorlink = Tristan Taormino | first = T. | last = Taormino | work = [[The Village Voice]] | date = 2000-01-19 to 2000-01-25 | accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''money shot''' (also called a &quot;money-making&quot; shot&lt;ref&gt;From the &quot;Filmmaker's Dictionary&quot; by Ralph S. Singleton and James A. Conrad, edited by Janna Wong Healy, (2nd edition, 2000, Lone Eagle Publishing Co., Hollywood, California).&lt;/ref&gt;) is a provocative, sensational, or memorable sequence in a film, on which the film's commercial performance is perceived to depend.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Money Shot&quot;. Oxford English Dictionary Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The term originates from mainstream feature filmmakers, who used the term &quot;money shot&quot; as slang for the image that costs the most money to produce.&lt;ref name= Mills&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/17/money_shot_intro.html Extract] of ''The Money Shot'' by Jane Mills.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of a dam bursting might be called the &quot;money shot&quot; of the film. Or, in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]'', [[Bill Oakley]] has referred to a key shot where Homer steps into a 3D world as the &quot;money shot&quot;.

A money shot has also been used as another name for a [[cum shot]] in pornographic films. The shot was so named because if a male actor could not provide this shot he would not be paid.  It has also been argued that this is the filmed moment the audience has paid to see.&lt;ref name= Mills&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/01/17/money_shot_intro.html Extract] of ''The Money Shot'' by Jane Mills.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Ziplow, author of ''The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography '', &quot;...the cum shot, or, as some refer to it, 'the money shot', is the most important element in the movie and that everything else (if necessary) should be sacrificed at its expense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mills, ''The Money Shot: Cinema, Sin and Censorship''. Pluto Press, Annandale 2001. ISBN 1 86403 142 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Williams (United States film critic)|Linda Williams]] has argued that, &quot;The money shot is thus an obvious perversion - in the literal sense of the term, as a swerving away from more &quot;direct&quot; forms of genital engagement - of the tactile sexual connection.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has gained acceptance in pop culture and is sometimes used in conversation.  Borrowing the meaning from the pornographic film industry, the term is used to refer to a highly anticipated or satisfying end, but in a non-pornographic context.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Point of view pornography''' (POV) is [[adult entertainment]] that is filmed as if the watcher had experienced the sex-acts themselves.
In  POV porn the man receiving sexual gratification holds the camera himself and aims it down at the actress or actor who is pleasuring him. This is in contrast to having a separate camera crew filming the action. The effect is to give the viewer the sense that they are experiencing the sexual acts they are watching, as opposed to simply watching others as a voyeur. Most POV porn is classed as [[Gonzo pornography]]. Influenced by [[Amateur pornography]], in 1989 [[John Stagliano]] hit on the idea of performing in a film whilst also operating the camera, so that the viewer experiences the film through the eyes of his character. The first-person perspective was influenced by the 1960's film ''[[Blowup]]''.&lt;ref name=Headpress&gt;{{cite book|title=Headpress: Powered by Love|publisher=[[Headpress]]|author=O'Toole, Laurence &amp; Kerekes, David |year=2003|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DJU0uP5-MsoC|isbn=1900486229|page=16,17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time this was in contrast to the majority of porn, which tended not to make viewers aware of the camera.&lt;ref name=Headpress/&gt; In Japan the genre is known as [[Hamedori]].

They can be contrasted with &quot;free-sites&quot;, which do not charge a membership fee.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; Most paysites offer &quot;free tours&quot; which allow non-members to view a limited number of short trailers.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;  The vast majority of paysite memberships are bought by men.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest paysites began by scanning images from [[pornographic magazines]].&lt;ref name=Williams100&gt;Williams, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sites then grew until the market was saturated, and now many thousands of sites offer almost every conceivable [[List of pornographic sub-genres|pornographic niche]].&lt;ref name=Williams100/&gt;

Because there is so much free porn available on the internet (e.g. [[thumbnail gallery post|TGPs]]), some users have long decided to consume only free porn, and thus spurn pressure to become paying customers.  However, paysites are often one of the main originators of new content, they're one way an administrator can pay for the bandwidth costs, and they're one of the most conspicuous ways in the industry to try to turn a profit. Theoretically, the more revenue a site takes in, the higher quality content it can produce.

Payment methods include [[credit card]] and/or [[checking account]] [[billing]].

Most paysites prevent unauthorized access to their members area by means of a [[username]] and [[password]].&lt;ref name=Klar/&gt;

A problem that paysites have is [[intellectual property]] protection, even with well-secured sites: there are cases of so-called &quot;site rips&quot;, i.e. sites are either [[hack]]ed, or [[subscriber]]s redistributed content from a member's area without authorization; there have thus been sightings of original content on other TGP sites or entire site rip archives on [[file sharing]] networks. Administrators may try to counter these problems by employing [[copy protection]] technologies.

Because members must confirm some details of their identity when they make their payment, a touted advantage of paysites is the potential to keep some children and minors from unwanted and/or illegal access. The issue of how to protect these internet audiences from [[internet pornography|pornographic material]] deemed harmful to them has been widely debated in the U.S. in light of the 1998 federal [[Child Online Protection Act|COPA]] act.

Many paysites attract potential paying customers by providing a portion of their content for free via [[free hosted galleries]] (FHGs),&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; and use an [[affiliate marketing|affiliate]] program to drive new traffic to those FHGs.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of unique visitors to FHGs who become paying members is known as the ''conversion ratio''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cozyfrog.com/guides/money/articles/PaysiteNumbers.asp|title=Crunching Paysite Numbers!|publisher=Cozy Frog|date=2002-10-12|author=Edward Cone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Thomas Rowlandson (8).jpg|thumb|225px|by Thomas Rowlandson, c. 1800]]

'''Clothed male, naked (or nude) female''' (on the internet sometimes abbreviated to '''CMNF''') is a genre of [[erotica]] featuring one or more [[nudity|nude]] women and one or more clothed men. Some people regard such depictions to be [[pornography]]. It is sometimes described as a [[sexual fantasy]] depicting such a scenario.  

The general theme of CMNF is fairly broad, encompassing several different types of sexual and nonsexual scenarios. The most common subdivisions of the genre as a sexual scenario involve activity under the rubric of [[male domination]], [[female submission]], [[exhibitionism]], or [[entertainment]].  CMNF is also considered by some to be a form of [[sexual objectification]] of women by men.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

CMNF can further be divided into two distinct categories with reference to attitudes towards female nudity:  

*The first category can be described as &quot;Nice CMNF&quot;, in which the female participant is often willingly naked and clearly enjoys her nudity and derives sexual arousal from it.  Generally, in Nice CMNF situations, the female finds herself encouraged to be naked and receives positive encouragement from both male and female participants.  Although Nice CMNF often contains a subtext of power imbalances between naked females and clothed males, it is also common for a female in a Nice CMNF situation to regard her nudity as empowering or liberating.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}
*The second category can be described as &quot;Hard CMNF.&quot;  In Hard CMNF, the female participant typically finds herself naked against her will, and the focus is on the embarrassment/humiliation she experiences in the situation.  Hard CMNF can contain elements of [[BDSM]] and is often seen in depictions of [[erotic punishment]], such as [[erotic spanking|spanking]].  Male domination often plays a much larger role in Hard CMNF, and a female participant is more likely to view her nudity as humiliating or demeaning.  Like Nice CMNF, female participants in Hard CMNF will often derive sexual pleasure from their nudity.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

The opposite is [[Clothed female, naked male]] (CFNM).

==As a theme in art==

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

One-sided female nudity has also been depicted in art, particularly in the [[orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings of the 19th-century. A typical scene would often contain depictions of [[sexual slavery|white slavery]] in which one or several nude females would be displayed before an audience of men as part of a slave auction.  The archetypal example of this type of scene is [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]'s ''The Slave Market'', in which a nude female slave is examined by a potential buyer.  Another example is Gérôme's ''Phryné devant l'Areopage'' (''Phryne before the [[Areopagus]]'', 1861) which was based on the trial of [[Phryne]] before the Areopagus in ancient Greece. The [[odalisque]] (harem scene) was also a popular subject for depicting one-sided female nudity, although the clothed figures in the scene were not always male.

Outside of the Orientalist style, a less popular CMNF theme in 19th-century art was the knight-errant, in which the stereotype of the [[damsel in distress]] was used to explore the erotic subtext of the powerful knight coming to the rescue of a helpless female.  The best known example of this is John Everett Millais' painting ''[[Knight Errant]]'', in which a nude woman has been tied to a tree and a knight is shown cutting her loose.  The painting initially created controversy when it was first displayed, because the nude female was shown facing her rescuer, a posture which was considered too sexually suggestive for European audiences. &lt;ref&gt;Refer to the section on &quot;The Problem Nude&quot; in these notes from 2005/2006 course lectures given by Carol Jacobi at Birkbeck College: http://www.shafe.co.uk/art/19thC_The_Nude.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Millais repainted the figure so that she was looking away from her rescuer.  &lt;ref&gt; A recreation of what the original painting may have looked like can be viewed on Oxfordshire Church Illustrations' Flickr photostream:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/oxfordshire_church_photos/1898994511/&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction of shock by 19th-century audiences highlights the potential of CMNF as a mechanism for both challenging and reinforcing gender stereotypes.

[[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (&quot;The Luncheon on the Grass&quot;), in which a nude woman is depicted having lunch with two fully clothed men, is another famous painting whose themes were controversial when it was first displayed in 1863. ''Concert Champêtre (Pastoral Concert)'' c. 1509 attributed to [[Titian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225139&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500816&amp;bmUID=1185639440044&amp;bmLocale=en From the Louvre Museum Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; has been cited as an inspiration for Manet's painting.

==In literature==

CMNF has been a topic in literature, appearing in both fiction and non-fiction stories (although rarely, if ever, is it specifically referred to using the acronym CMNF).

The topic of one-sided female nudity is featured in the book ''Topping from Below'' by [[Laura Reese]]&lt;ref&gt;''Topping from Below'', by Laura Reese, ISBN 0312144350, St Martin's Griffin Ed (May 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;. The journalist Nora Tibbs investigates the death of her sister Franny. She meets the boy-friend of Franny, “M.”, a music professor, and becomes his new girl-friend. He forces her to be nude all the time when she is in his house. Her one-sided nudity is one of many tokens of her submission to him. 

Entertainment columnist [[Earl Wilson]] details several experiences involving one-sided female nudity in his book ''Show Business Laid Bare.''&lt;ref&gt;''Show Business Laid Bare'', by Earl Wilson, ISBN 0399112766, New York, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1974. Second Printing &lt;/ref&gt;  In the chapter titled &quot;Cheri Caffaro: A Strange Interlewd,&quot; Wilson writes about his experience interviewing actress [[Cheri Caffaro]] while she was nude and he was fully dressed. &lt;ref&gt;The story can be found on pages 45-56 of the hardcover second printing of the book. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Erotic entertainment==
[[Image:Nudefest3.jpeg|thumb|right|A Nudes-A-Poppin contestant poses for photographs.]]
[[Image:Nudefest.jpeg|thumb|right|A Nudes-A-Poppin contestant performs onstage.]]

Social gatherings of men and women interested in this type of erotic pursuit do occur, although the initialism CMNF is not always used to describe such activities.  Examples include the Nudes-A-Poppin Pageant &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nudes-a-poppin.com/ Nudes-A-Poppin' Pageants]&lt;/ref&gt;, which is an annual event hosted by the Ponderosa Sun Club, and modern burlesque shows such as Behind the Pink Door &lt;ref&gt;[http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=73202871 MySpace.com - Burlesque Behind The Pink Door - 27 - Fille - SEATTLE, US - www.myspace.com/burlyqbehindthepinkdoor]&lt;/ref&gt;, where performer Lily Verlaine &lt;ref&gt;[http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=111310608 MySpace.com - Lily Verlaine - SEATTLE, Washington - Classique / Glam / Jazz - www.myspace.com/lilyverlaine]&lt;/ref&gt; recreates onstage Manet's ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''.

Several websites cater to the various subdivisions of CMNF.  Well known examples include Nude-in-Public.com, &lt;ref&gt;www.nude-in-public.com&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses primarily on female [[exhibitionism]], A Measure of Curiosity, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-m-o-c.com/ A Measure of Curiosity - Dedicated to Girls Undressing]&lt;/ref&gt; whose content is largely based on entertainment in the form of photo stories involving females playing stripping games and ending up naked in various situations, and Slaves in Love &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slavesinlove.com/ slaves in love]&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on [[BDSM]] and [[male domination]], often with aspects of CMNF depicted in its photos and videos.  

It should be noted that while websites may feature CMNF content, rarely do they label themselves as being part of the CMNF genre, unlike most [[CFNM]] sites, which generally contain the acronym in their website name and make explicit reference to CFNM content. &lt;ref&gt;For a typical example of this type of self-identification on a CFNM website, see: http://www.cfnm.net/&lt;/ref&gt;  One notable exception was CMNF.co.uk, a now defunct website which both used the CMNF acronym in its website name and made specific reference to CMNF content in its pictorials.&lt;ref&gt;Although the website no longer exists, its home page can be viewed as it appeared in 2007 here: http://web.archive.org/web/20070312183007/http://cmnf.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond niche websites, CMNF continues to enjoy mainstream popularity at [[bachelor parties]], [[strip clubs]] and [[erotic conventions]], where the majority of viewers are male and the performers are female.

      <comment>/* CFNM fantasy and humiliation/punishment */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Unreferenced|date=April 2009}}
'''Clothed female, naked (or nude) male''' (on the internet sometimes abbreviated to '''CFNM''') is a genre of [[erotica]] featuring one or more [[nudity|nude]] men and one or more clothed women. The purpose of this type of pornography is that the male is fully (or mostly) nude and the women around him (or them) deny him (or them) the pleasure of seeing them in the same state of undress. It is sometimes described as a [[sexual fantasy]] depicting such a scenario.  

The general theme of CFNM is fairly broad, encompassing several different types of sexual and nonsexual scenarios. The most common subdivisions of the genre as a sexual scenario involve activity under the rubric of [[female domination]], [[male submission]], [[exhibitionism]], or [[entertainment]]; combination of all categories is somewhat rare, although several web sites cater to the sub genres separately.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}  CFNM is also considered by some to be a form of [[sexual objectification]] of men by women or as a [[role reversal]].

The establishment of CFNM as a specific form of erotic interest did not occur until the creation of the Internet at which time the concept was explored in various discussion forums, and then named.{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

The opposite is [[clothed male, naked female]] (CMNF).

== CFNM fantasy and humiliation/punishment ==

Unlike CMNF, CFNM is not divided into categories Nice CFNM and Hard CFNM. There are many reasons why the male participants receive pleasure from the CFNM experience. Many males enjoy being completely nude around females and do not tend to be disappointed that the females are fully clothed while experiencing the sexual pleasure given by females including [[masturbation]]. While the male figures in CMNF are almost fully clothed, the females in CFNM often are seen in only their undergarments.

However some male participants often feel humiliated during the experience. Like the females in Hard CMNF, the focus is on the embarrassment/humiliation he experiences in the situation.

== CFNM in music video ==
* [[Connection (Elastica song)|Connection by Elastica]]

==CFNM in film==
''[[Porky's Revenge]]'' (1985) has a scene in which the boys' basketball team is tricked into thinking that they were going to have an orgy with the cheerleaders. Before they jump into the pool the boys strip down to their boxers and the girls to their swimsuits. Then the girls trick the boys into taking off their boxers while the girls throw a different swimsuit that came from a bag that they passed around so they could keep their suits on. When the boys approach the girls, the girls raced to the deep end and made the boys get out without their suits, and the girls filmed them.

'''''Gay-for-pay''''' describes male (and, less frequently, female) actors, pornographic stars, or [[prostitution|sex workers]] who self-identify as [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] but who are paid to act or perform [[homosexuality|gay]] professionally. The term has also applied to other professions and even companies with the same core concerns and criticism in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blazin Squad, gay 4 pay?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips  |first=James  |title=Blazin Squad, gay 4 pay?

 |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma of being gay or labeled as such has steadily eroded since the [[Stonewall riots]] began the modern [[gay rights]] movement in 1969. Through the 1990s, mainstream movie and television actors have been more willing to portray homosexuality, as the threat of any backlash against their careers has lessened and society's acceptance of gay and lesbian people has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;pewreport&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Pew Global Attitudes Project |title=Views of a Changing World |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=185 |format=.PDF |year=2003 |month=June |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Pew Research Center For The People &amp; The Press | oclc=52547041 |accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the gay pornography industry, which uses amateurs as well as professional actors, the term ''gay-for-pay'' refers to actors labeled or believed to be straight but who engage in same-sex activities and/or intercourse for money.  Some actors who are actually gay or bisexual will be marketed as straight to appeal to the &quot;allure of the unattainable&quot;, because straight men (or those newly [[coming out]]) are [[virgin]]s to sex with other men, and &quot;as in most gay male settings, the young, the muscular, and the unfamiliar are more sought.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sought&quot;&gt; Leap, William L [http://books.google.com/books?id=YXUP4JmJo_0C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;ots=XhkEisbf6Z&amp;dq=troll+gay+sex&amp;sig=6kAawESJfOwZvrWhW2EFB-srfzU &quot;Public Sex/Gay Space By William L.

__TOC__
==Mainstream actors==
A heterosexual actor who plays an [[LGBT]] character in movies, television shows, or theatre may have extra attention paid to the possibility that they were themselves gay, although that trend has diminished.&lt;ref&gt; [http://books.google.com/books?id=qMOnrrJqRr8C ''Still acting gay: male homosexuality in modern drama''] John M. Clum, Palgrave Macmillan, 2000; ISBN 0312223846, 9780312223847.&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent examples include: [[Christopher Meloni]]  in ''[[Oz]]'', [[Will Smith]] in ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'', [[Hilary Swank]] in ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', [[Eric McCormack]] in ''[[Will and Grace]]'', [[Keanu Reeves]] in ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'', [[Matt Damon]] in ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'', [[Heath Ledger]] and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] in ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', [[Judy Davis]] in ''[[Serving in Silence]]'', [[Sean Penn]] in ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'', [[Charlize Theron]] in ''[[Monster (film)|Monster]]'', and [[Mitch Hewer]] in ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]''. In this sense, their characters are gay, rather than any explicit sexual act that the actors may perform. 

Many LGBT roles are purposely void of overt displays of sexuality that are commonplace for heterosexual roles. Often the &quot;big gay scene&quot; involves a lip-on-lip kissing or implied sexual coupling. One storyline from the popular primetime TV series ''[[Will and Grace]]'' centered on the two gay male characters protesting [[NBC]] for editing out the big gay kiss that had been promised.&lt;ref&gt;Season 2-14 of ''[[Will and Grace]]''; &quot;Acting Out&quot; originally aired February 22, 2000. Jack is outraged when NBC decides not to air a gay kiss as promised.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some in the gay community have criticized Hollywood actors and film studios for &quot;whitewashing&quot; the gayness of some gay characters. More recently, &quot;playing gay&quot; in [[Independent film|Indie films]] (usually for lower pay) has become an opportunity for Hollywood actors to showoff their ''gravitas'' and acting range like [[Russell Crowe]] in ''[[The Sum of Us]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay 4 Pay - Straight Actors&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 |last=von Metzke 
 |first=Ross
 |title=Gay 4 Pay - Straight Actors in Gay Roles
 |publisher=Gay Wired

 |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up through the early 1990s, when [[Tom Hanks]] played a gay character suffering from AIDS in ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', most Hollywood actors avoided playing homosexual or transgender characters for fear of being identified too closely with the characters they played. (British actors had been &quot;playing gay&quot; for at least a decade; e.g., [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Rupert Graves]], and [[Jeremy Irons]]). More recently actors have been emboldened to take on all manner of roles including [[LGBT]] characters like [[James Marsden]] in the psychological thriller/AIDS drama ''[[The 24th Day]]'' and the ensemble drama ''[[Heights]]'', [[Guy Pearce]] in ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'', [[Clive Owen]] in ''[[Bent (play)|Bent]]'' and [[Paul Rudd]] in ''[[The Object of My Affection]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay 4 Pay - Straight Actors&quot;/&gt;

==Pornography==
In gay pornographic movies, actors who identify themselves as heterosexual, but who nevertheless perform explicit sexual acts with other males on film (e.g., [[Ryan Idol]], [[Clay Maverick]], [[Mike Branson]], [[Jeff Stryker]], [[Wolf Hudson]], [[Christian XXX|Christian]], [[Aaron James (porn star)|Aaron James]], [[Peter North (actor)|Peter North]], [[Joe Dallesandro]]) do not face the same stigmas as the mainstream acting counterparts and indeed can rise quickly to being featured actors.  These actors often play the &quot;[[Top (sex)|top]]&quot; roles but this is not always the case, such as with [[Kristen Bjorn]] and some [[Bel Ami (adult film company)|Bel Ami]] models.  Kurt Wild, who appeared as a bottom in [[Lucas Entertainment]]'s ''Gigolos'', is married with three children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bananaguide.com/article/18084 Kurt Wild: Married with children], Banana Guide, January 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Female-on-female sex in straight porn does not usually carry the same level of stigma as male gay-for-pay sex. Indeed it is a strong fantasy subject so references to female porn actors as gay-for-pay are more rare.

There is a proliferation of gay pornographic videos with a story that features an ostensibly heterosexual male being seduced into a gay male sexual act. An example of this is [[Latino Fan Club]], a film production company which specializes in producing amateur gay pornographic films in which pornographic actors are billed as &quot;Straight Latino Street Thugs&quot; appear to reluctantly have sex with one another. The video production company website also offers contact information for hiring these &quot;straight&quot; models as [[escort]]s and [[prostitute]]s.

People involved in the gay pornographic industry consider that some gay pornographic actors who identify as straight are not truly heterosexual. Because some gay men consider heterosexual men to be objects of fantasy, some gay porn producers have almost certainly described some actors as heterosexual to increase sales and publicity for their product.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proven Strait: Movie Review&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine

 |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many gay or bisexual men who star in gay porn films may wish to be identified publicly as heterosexual for personal or professional reasons.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

Some straight actors have started acting in gay porn only to be accused of being gay while others first step was to strictly do solo scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fabscout&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine

 |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher pay scale and profile within a production often leads to group scenes where a straight actor only &quot;tops&quot;. Many times a &quot;top&quot; actor will then be sought as a bottom and the debut is often treated as a notable event or even its own release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Justice&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine

===Motivation===
Most male pornographic actors are paid much less than their female counterparts in straight porn.  Male porn actors, however, get paid more, on the average, in gay porn than in straight porn.  There are also more opportunities to become a &quot;star&quot; in gay porn than in straight porn where the focus of attention remains on the actresses.  As a response to criticism in the gay community, some of these actors (perhaps with the advice of their publicists) would sometimes claim that they are in fact bisexual although they are indeed &quot;gay&quot; for the money.

There is also a theory that some of the &quot;straight&quot; actors are actually [[closeted]] or [[bisexual]] and using their acting in gay porn is a legitimate career step which allows them to also experiment with their sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Getting Behind Gay Porn Productions&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex workers==
In the sex worker industry, the term may also be applied to straight and bisexual people of all genders (including &quot;[[male escort]]s&quot;) who have sexual contact or scenes with a client or another sex worker of the same gender.  Although sexual contact is often involved, sex scenes or solo scenes (like masturbating to climax) or even a [[BDSM]] scene for the client's stimulation can take place.  Sexual arousal without direct sexual contact may also occur in such niche trade like muscle worship.  As in porn work, a gay-identity is not necessary to make money from a gay clients and consumers.

==Go-go dancers==
[[Go-go dancing]] originated in the 1960s and were eventually appropriated by [[burlesque]] and [[striptease]] establishments, which in turn became known as &quot;go-go bars&quot; but many [[gay club]]s had male go-go dancers (called ''go-go boys'') during the period 1965-1968.  After that, few gay clubs had go-go dancers until 1988, when go-go dancing again became fashionable (and has remained so ever since). &quot;Go-go dancers&quot; that perform at night clubs, special parties, [[circuit parties]] or [[rave]] dances in colorful bright costumes (which may include battery operated lights), with fire sticks, or with a snake can also be called ''performance art dancers'' or ''box dancers''. Large [[circuit parties]] and gay clubs often have very attractive go-go boys of all sexualities who will allow patrons to touch and rub them but only for [[tip]]s. This is typical in Thai venues, such as in [[Sunee Plaza]], Pattaya. Some criticize the practice of employing straight dancers to perform erotically for gay audiences when gay performers are available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hillary and Condi and Dykes&quot;&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Pin-up 1.jpg|thumb|[[Pin-up]] art by Patrick Hitte]]'''Upskirt''' is a [[:slang]] term usually referring to '''up skirt photography''', images of the view up a woman's [[skirt]] (as seen from underneath), including shots of a woman's [[underwear]] or crotch, or exposing her [[vulva]] or [[buttocks]]. Alternatively, an &quot;upskirt&quot;&lt;!-- Deviates from MoS.

While upskirt images may be captured consensually, many viewers seek such images taken surreptitiously (and presumably without the subject's consent).

==Etymology==
Bukkake is the noun form of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] verb ''bukkakeru'' (ぶっ掛ける, to dash or splash water),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/744/The+(Almost)+Complete+Japanzine+Dictionary+of+Japan+Sex Dictionary of Japan Sex]&lt;/ref&gt; and means &quot;To dash&quot;, &quot;splash&quot; or &quot;heavy splash&quot;.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fantabulosa&gt;{{cite book|title=Fantabulosa: a dictionary of Polari and gay slang|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|author=Paul Baker |year=2004|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T72TJfZoywAC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0826473431|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound verb can be decomposed into two verbs: ''butsu'' (ぶつ) and ''kakeru'' (掛ける). ''Butsu'' literally means to hit, but in this usage it appears to be an intensive prefix as in ''buttamageru'' (ぶったまげる, &quot;completely astonished&quot;) or ''butchigiri'' (ぶっちぎり, &quot;overwhelming win&quot;). 

''Kakeru'' in this context means to shower or pour. The word ''bukkake'' is often used in Japanese to describe pouring out water with sufficient momentum to cause splashing or spilling.  Indeed, bukkake is used in Japan to describe a type of dish where the broth is poured on top of noodles, as in bukkake-[[udon]] and bukkake-[[soba]]. 

==History==
The common legend is that bukkake originated in ancient Japan, where an unfaithful woman was publicly punished by being tied up as every man in town ejaculated onto her face.&lt;ref name=cake&gt;''[http://abstracts.co.allenpress.com/pweb/sexo2005/document/50214 Bake a Cake? Exposing the Sexual Practice of Bukkake]''. Hudson, Jeff; Doong, Nicholas. XVII World Congress of Sexology, Montreal, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt; The existence of such a practice in ancient Japan is disputed, and the supposed ancient origins of bukkake may be an [[urban legend]].

Bukkake was first represented in [[pornographic films]] in the mid to late 1980s in Japan.&lt;ref name=Fantabulosa/&gt;&lt;ref name=cake/&gt; A significant factor in the development of bukkake as a pornographic form was the mandatory censorship of genitalia in Japan.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Genitals must be [[Pixelization|pixelated]] by a &quot;mosaic&quot;.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; One consequence of this is that Japanese pornography tends to focus more on the face and body of actresses, rather than their genitals.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Since film producers could not show penetration they sought other ways to depict sex acts without violating Japanese law.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Semen was not required to be censored, thus creating a loophole for harder sex scenes.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The first known recorded and publicly released act of ''bukkake'' in [[Japanese pornography]] was in the movie {{nihongo|''Mascot Note''|マスカットノート}} starring Matsuoka Aiko, released in December 1986, the act being previously known simply as {{nihongo|''gansha''|顔射|&quot;facial ejaculation&quot;}}.  However, popularization of the act and the term for it has been credited to director [[Kazuhiko Matsumoto]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/04/63009?currentPage=2 |title=Fix for Japan Pop-Culture Addicts |accessdate=2009-07-01 |author=Xeni Jardin |date=2004-12-04 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|wired.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice then spread from Japan to American and then European pornography after US porn producers discovered Japanese bukkake videos in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=cake/&gt;&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sigel&gt;{{cite book|title=International exposure: perspectives on modern European pornography, 1800-2000|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|author=Lisa Z.

The practice then spread to [[gay pornography]], in which several men ejaculate on another man.&lt;ref name=Fantabulosa/&gt;&lt;ref name=cake/&gt; Pornographic use of the word has been expanded by the ''[[lesbian bukkake]]'' series, in which several women purportedly [[Female ejaculation|ejaculate]] on another woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = [[Ashley Blue]] (Director) | title = Lesbian Bukkake | medium = [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] | publisher = JM Productions |accessdate=2007-04-20 |date=  2004 |url=http://www.iafd.com/title.asp?title=Lesbian+Bukkake+1&amp;year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sargeant |first=Jack |authorlink=Jack Sargeant |year=2006 |month=November |volume=9 |issue=5 |title=Filth and Sexual Excess: Some Brief Reflections on Popular Scatology |journal=Media and Culture Journal |url=http://www.journal.media-culture.org.au/0610/03-sargeant.php |accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''American Bukkake'' is a film series focussing on bukkake produced by [[JM Productions]] and directed by Jim Powers.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake&gt;pp.31-37 ''My, My American Bukkake'' by Susannah Breslin in Greta Christina, Daniel Clowes, ''Best Erotic Comics 2008, illustrated edition'', Last Gasp, 2007. ISBN 0867196866&lt;/ref&gt; JM shoots scenes in [[North Hollywood]] every Wednesday night, for three weeks running, every third month.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt; The male performers are members of the public who have replied to newspaper adverts or have called the &quot;bukkake hotline&quot; telephone number.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt; Normally 50 to 100 men take part, who are paid $35 each.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt; Some of the men disguise their identities by wearing masks or bandanas over their faces.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt; The female performers are professional pornographic actresses, and are paid $500 for a shoot that usually lasts around two hours.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt; On [[21 May]] [[2001]] JM's offices were raided by twenty officers from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. The officers confiscated several bukkake-themed videos. In response Jeff Steward stated, &quot;Some guy swims in feces on MTV, and that's OK? But for a girl to swallow 80 loads of cum is obscene? I dont think so.&quot; On the evening of the raid, Jim Powers was in North Hollywood filming another ''American Bukkake'' film. In reference to what he considered the injustice of the raid, he announced to the men involved, &quot;We're doing this for all of America&quot;.&lt;ref name=americanbukkake/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''MILF''', an [[acronym]] for &quot;'''mother I'd like to fuck'''&quot;, is a common colloquial term generally regarded as vulgar when spelled out.  Slight variations include ''mom I'd like to fuck'', or the non-vulgar ''mother I'd like to find'' or ''mother I'd like to fool-around-with''.

==Usage==

MILF denotes a sexually attractive older female, generally between 35 and 50 in age, and not necessarily an actual mother. In the proper use of the term, the female in question should be old enough to be the mother of the person proclaiming her attractiveness.  The term was popularized by the film ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]] ''(1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-10-30/columns/the-rise-of-milfs-and-mommies-in-sexual-fantasy-material/ | title= The Rise of MILFs and Mommies in Sexual-Fantasy Material |last=Taormino |first=Tristan|date=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the origin of the term predates this (the term was already used for years on the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.mag.playboy/browse_thread/thread/56546dc2e5578c7/ae98e3c554d34114?lnk=st|Usenet_done=%2Fgroup%2Falt.mag.playboy%2Fbrowse_thread%2Fthread%2F56546dc2e5578c7%2Fae98e3c554d34114%3Flnk%3Dst%257CUsenet An example of 1995 internet usage of 'MILF' predating ''American Pie''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the term was used in ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' in a description of Bill's stepmom by Ted.
In 2007, [[Spirit Airlines]] ran a promotional campaign titled &quot;M.I.L.F.&quot;, described as meaning &quot;Many Islands, Low Fares&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Over the Line? |series=The O'Reilly Factor |serieslink=The O'Reilly Factor |network=Fox News Channel  |airdate=2007-12-11 |transcripturl=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,316578,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tori Amos]]' song &quot;Big Wheel&quot; on her 2007 album ''American Doll Posse'' refers to herself (or rather the character she portrays in the song) as a MILF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hereinmyhead.com/collect/adp/adp02.html | title= Big Wheel lyrics  |first=Hereinmyhead.com|date=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lightspeed Media Corporation''' is a company from [[Glendale, Arizona]], founded in 1999 by [[Steve Lightspeed]], alias of Steve Jones,&lt;ref name=StartupJournal&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last= Kesmodel |title=Keeping an Adult Biz And Family Life Separate |url=http://www.startupjournal.com/runbusiness/family/20060414-kesmodel.html |work= |publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]] [[Startup Journal]]'' |date=[[April 14]], [[2006]] |accessdate=2007-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that operates many [[Internet pornography]] [[Web sites]] and contracts various models.  (There was also a Lightspeed Media, which is a distinct corporation that was acquired by America Online on March 10, 1997.) [https://gsbapps.stanford.edu/cases/documents/SM75.pdf]

Their models include Sweet Devon, Kinzie Kenner, Mandy Lightspeed, Erica Lightspeed, Britney Lightspeed, Brandy Didder, Dirty Aly, XXXRaimi, Tiffany Paris, Stacy Bride, Ronni Tuscadero, and Lacey White.

Steve Jones is the company's [[Custodian of Records]] as required by American law [[Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act|18 U.S.C. 2257]].  He works to keep his public persona as Steve Lightspeed separate from his private one of Steve Jones.  The family moved after area parents learned about his profession and refused to let their children play with his.  But Lightspeed said his children do not know about what he, his wife and his mother do.

'''Tawnee Stone''' is the pseudonym for an [[United States|American]] [[Internet pornography]] model employed by Lightspeed Media.

Stone is also a very successful pioneer of the single-model per website style of internet promotion. From 2001-2005, her site has produced the top earnings of all Lightspeed Media websites. &quot;While Stone’s innocent look is probably most responsible for the site’s success, the fact is that everyone who releases a single-girl site is aiming to be the next Stone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avnonline.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Editorial&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=218248 | title=PROFILE 200503 - Lightspeed Cash: Embracing the Rock Star Phenomenon | accessdate=2007-06-26 | author=MJ McMahon | last=McMahon | first=MJ | date=2005-03-01 | year=2005 | month=03 | publisher=AVNOnline.com | pages=1 | language=English }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=December 2008}}

'''Jan Novak''' is a Czech director and producer of [[gay pornography|gay pornographic films]].

==Career==
Novak's career began while shooting with his camera as a hobby, and befriended William Higgins in the early 1990s. Novak soon opened a [[Gay bar|gay club]]  in [[Prague]], followed by a gay sex shop and mail order business - and then he began publishing his first gay erotic magazines in the [[Czech Republic]].

Soon, a friend convinced him to create his own photo production company, and Lukas Studios was born to give Novak's photography an outlet. His work caught the eye of Higgins's friend, George Mavety - owner of Mavety Media Group. Novak saw his pictures in the pages of ''[[Playguy]]'', ''[[Honcho]]'', ''[[Torso]]'', ''[[Mandate magazine|Mandate]]'', and ''Inches''. 

Novak initially resisted offers to produce videos... until the day he got a fax from [[Studio 2000]]  producers John Travis and [[Scott Masters]], who asked him to come to the United States. 

He was nominated for a [[GayVN Awards|GayVN Award]] and won a [[Grabby]]  (''Winning Ways'' took the 2001 award for Best International Video[http://www.media-imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Grabby_Awards/2001]), and he continued working with Studio 2000 for two years to develop its international line with titles like ''Good and Bad'', ''Strokes to Seduction'', ''Criminal Intent'', and ''The Back Room''. Novak's photography experience helped him compose films and he was hired as managing director of Bel Ami Prague office when his Studio 2000 stint was up.

In the spring of 2004, Novak left [[Bel Ami (adult film company)|Bel Ami]] and established Bubble B Entertainment, with ''Alluring Cumback'' its first release. [http://www.avn.com/index.cfm?objectID=F7836D5E-0710-850B-A8062829C04032E2&amp;slid=387774]

'''Gwen Media''' is an adult film company based in California, United States which produces mostly BDSM photographs and occasional films.  The current company is a successor to the original film company, using the same name and same commercial website url.  The current company produces mainly &quot;adult only&quot; photographs and occasional DVD films unlike the original company which mostly produced films.  

This new company is owned by notable BDSM performer and dominatrix, Isabella Sinclaire, who was one of the primary performers of the original company.

== Background ==

The original Gwen Media film company (formally known as &quot;Gwenmedia Los Angeles&quot;) was a Los Angeles, California based film company that concentrated in creating Latex and BDSM focused adult films (usually considered &quot;pornographic&quot; due to the usage of many specific &quot;adult only&quot; themes in their films which included BDSM, heavy bondage, implied sci-fi bodily conversions and full frontal nudity.  Gwen Media did NOT use female-to-female sex, except in a few of their produced films, such as &quot;Fetish Girls&quot;.  There was NO male-to-female sex in any of the original Gwen Media films that were publicly released).

The original Gwen Media was originally formed by Bob Zak and John Fitzgerald (see Thndrshark.com) as an outgrowth of Zak's fetish clothing business, &quot;Whiplash USA&quot;.[http://web.archive.org/web/20020404013626/whiplashusa.com/septindex.php]  Fitzgerald served as Gwen Media's original film director and primary screen writer until he left the original company in 2002.[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=276134]  Fitzgerald was ultimately replaced by Jon White as primary film director of the original company.  Jon White would later succeed Bob Zak as the Managing Producer of the company after Zak died in June 2005.[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=231947]

The original Gwen Media had been primarily producing adult films from late (generally considered September) 1999 until the then recognized management, led by Jon White, officially ended production of the original company in March 2006.[http://www.lustlovelatex.com/2006/03/gwenmedia-is-closing-down.htm]

In the beginning, the original Gwen Media produced only a few high-end production films a year due to their elaborate settings and production values which prevented &quot;factory mass production&quot;.[http://web.archive.org/web/20001017173049/www.gwenmedia.com/Videos.htm]  It would be these elaborate settings and emotional convincing performers that established Gwen Media as the premier fetish adult film company in the United States, surpassing the few United States specific fetish companies such as California Star and HOM Studios as well as the occasion film productions from outside the United States including notable long-time fetish producers [[Peter W. Czernich]] ''[[Marquis (magazine)]]'' of Germany and ''[[Skin Two]]'' of England.  Gwen Media developed a core audience and devoted fan following that allowed Gwen Media to increase their film production level to a regular production amount of approximately 4 films EACH MONTH of varying time lengths (45 min – 120 min) near the end of the original company's production life cycle in 2006, culminating in over 110 known released DVD movies.

The original Gwen Media's high success was largely attributed to a definite and continual focus by Zak and the production staff on using their successful fundamental basis of specific BDSM performers, elaborate sets and locales, definite scripts and high-end latex costuming in all their film productions.  Zak did not even offer photogalleries on the website until 2001, leaving the site only as a commercial re-sales site for the films.[http://web.archive.org/web/20001109173600/www.gwenmedia.com/Videos.htm]  Photography was almost exclusively used as promotional material for the films and &quot;test-out&quot; of audience interest to proposed film sessions and focuses.  It was this continual focus as a specific fetish film company that used direct audience feedback that contributed to the original company's success where other BDSM film makers had NOT gained a reliable footing into the adult market such as those produced by known BDSM specific adult film production companies including Rick Savage (Noose Videos)[http://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=RSavage/gender=m/Rick-Savage.htm], the late Bruce Sevens[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0786249/] and Bizarre Videos[http://www.bizarrevideo.com/].  The original Gwen Media would later form a distribution partnership with Bizarre Videos for their films.[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=231947] 

While many had thought the usage of definite scripts and elaborate plots and extensive full-body latex costuming would limit the &quot;porn&quot; audience for these films, it was those very factors that had developed the definite audience following of latex fetish fans who had very little specific fetish film product to select from and from more &quot;vanilla&quot; adult fans who wanted something more elaborate than the general offerings from generic adult film makers.  Through the course of their initial development, Gwen Media widely promoted many of their initial performers including Isabella Sinclaire (current owner of succeeding company), [[Jewell Marceau]], [[Emily Marilyn]] (aka Molly Matthews), [[Eden Wells]], Anastasia Pierce and [[Paige Richards]], as well as several of their later performers including Amanda Wildefyre, (Mistress) Aradia, and of course, Jean Bardot who has found large-scale acceptance in the fetish market in her role as &quot;Rubberella&quot;.[http://ainews.com/Archives/Story6638.phtml]  

The original Gwen Media's most successful products were their various continual high-end production film series, including &quot;Part-time&quot;; &quot;Ivy Manor&quot; (episode 5 entitled &quot;Teacher's Pet&quot; won 2003 AVN Best BDSM film,[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVN_Awards_2003] gathering large-scale adult film recognition for this &quot;niche&quot; fetish film company); &quot;Sessions&quot; (episode 8 was nominated for 2004 AVN Best BDSM film)[http://www.avnawards.com]; &quot;Crimson Mansion&quot;[http://ainews.com/Archives/Story5504.phtml] and &quot;Rubberella&quot;.

== Legal Dispute ends original company ==

The Gwen Media web site (www.gwenmedia.com) was closed in June 2006 with the front page displaying the message ''“Account for domain gwenmedia.com has been suspended”''
.  This unclear statement was posted after a public announcement was made in March 2006 by the succeeding management to actually end all productions of the company after the death of company owner and founder, Bob Zak, in June 2005 from heart failure.[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=231947]  The announcement was met with curiosity as it was assumed that the company had completely ended with the public statement in March 2006, and the site would be completely removed rather than being merely &quot;suspended&quot;.

The PUBLIC reason for this &quot;suspension&quot; was revealed in September 2006 to have been a legal dispute between one-time lead performer Isabella Sinclaire and company owner and producer, Bob Zak.

http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=276134

The case was based on ownership of key products of Gwen Media's production company, most notably the &quot;Ivy Manor&quot; film line which was considered the basis for the company's initial financial success and allowed Gwen Media to prosper and build up the company from that initial successful money generation.  Sinclaire was the main star of this Gwen Media film series.  Sinclaire stated that she owned the name of the series which was based on her company's incorporated name.  This challenge was disputed by Bob Zak who argued that the film series was their property.

In September 2006, the legal ownership case of the &quot;Ivy Manor&quot; series was determined in Sinclaire's favor.  In order to compensate Sinclaire for her legal fees, the judge in the case awarded Sinclaire complete ownership of Gwen Media and all its assets including all of the films.  This award was not limited to only the &quot;Ivy Manor&quot; series, but included all of Gwen Media's trademarks, photostock and properties.

== New company and Recent Events ==

After being awarded full legal ownership of the original company,[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=276134] Sinclaire has announced publicly that she intends to reactivate Gwen Media as a fully separate, though completely owned, company parallel to her original adult film company, &quot;Ivy Manor Videos&quot;.

Sinclaire continues to operate and produce for her own original adult film company &quot;Ivy Manor Videos&quot; at this time.  

Sinclaire has reactivated Gwen Media as an active production company as of February 14, 2007, after placing her re-activication notice on the Gwen Media website on December 12, 2006.

Though awarded of all Gwen Media's trademarks, products, and resources, Sinclaire has made no indication that she would reactivate other Gwen Media associated companies at this time such as &quot;Crimson Mansion&quot; or &quot;American Pinups&quot;.  `Originally, such websites were &quot;suspended&quot;.[http://www.crimsonmansion.com]  These supplementary companies and subsidiaries of the original company have been sold/released as of October 2008 and are no longer part of Gwen Media.

Sinclaire has not stated publicly whether she will rehire any of the former management of Zak's incarnation of the company for her incarnation of Gwen Media.  Sinclaire DID state publicly that she was in negotiations to work with co-founder John Fitzgerald to write new stories for her incarnation of Gwen Media.[http://www.avn.com/index.php?Primary_Navigation=Articles&amp;Action=View_Article&amp;Content_ID=276134]  According to the report, Sinclaire stated she had &quot;contacted John Fitzgerald and we will be continuing the Ivy Manor series until we complete the 10-part series as planned&quot;.  Sinclaire has stated in her first public press release for her incarnation of Gwen Media (dated February 14, 2007) that their association is a permanent one as Fitzgerald has been hired as creative producer and primary film director for the successive company[http://www.gwenmedia.com/news.html].

Sinclaire has not stated publicly whether she will continue to follow the latex fetish focus of Bob Zak's production or change to her own noted BDSM style which does not use latex fetish as the primary focus either at this time.  However based on some of the initial photo productions that have been publicly released, it seems that she will maintain the latex sci-fi focus at least for the initial time.

== Possible future legal dispute ==

There is a quiet contention at this time that the famous &quot;Rubberella&quot; character, primarily portrayed by noted fetish performer Jean Bardot, is also now part of Isabella Sinclaire's Gwen Media.  The Rubberella character was originally created by Zak and Bardot to be marketed specifically as part of Gwen Media.[http://ainews.com/Archives/Story5942.phtml]  Bardot has stated that she was awarded control of the property by former manager Jon White before White ended the company in March 2006.  But the judge who awarded Sinclaire control over all Gwen Media assets and trademarks did not state an exclusion for this character.  Thus Sinclaire could restart Rubberella as well as any of the other original series with completely new performers, akin to the ''[[James Bond]]'' film franchise where many different actors have portrayed the same character.

What is known is that Bardot has stated that she does NOT have legal rights to re-release any of the seven films that she portrayed the Rubberella character for Zak's Gwen Media which was awarded and transferred to Sinclaire's ownership.  Many believe that Sinclaire and Bardot are quietly trying to come to an agreement on the matter without having to bring any legal contention to the matter as to the rights of the creator (Bardot) versus that of the producer (Sinclaire).

Recently both the new Gwen Media and Jean Bardot's Rubberella websites have celebrated the return of Gwen Media with photoshoots featuring Sinclaire and Bardot together. The series on the Rubberella site (entitled &quot;Exam Room&quot;) includes Sinclaire giving Bardot a kiss which leave a large lipstick mark, which remains in subsequent photos in the series. This kiss suggests that the two have come to some public agreement involving the Rubberella character (having &quot;kissed and made up&quot;).  While this initial public promotion campaign capitalizes on the success of one of the most successful of the former Gwen Media products, neither Bardot nor Sinclaire have stated whether they will continue to work together at this time beyond this initial public promotion campaign.

=== New Gwenmedia ends Classic Rubberella ===

On Friday, July 6, 2007, a message was posted on the &quot;Rubberella&quot; website formally stating that there was an ending of Jean Bardot's association with the character

:&quot;-MEMBERS-
:Jean Bardot is no longer Rubberella !! www.Rubberella.com as you know it will no longer, in anyway, be associated to or with Jean Bardot.&quot;

This message obviously indicates that Isabella is indeed the controller of the character and will continue to use the character as part of her new Gwen Media in future projects.  At the current time, it is unclear who will succeed Jean in the role of Rubberella if the series is to be restarted at all.  

There was no listing of the reason of the ending of Jean's involvement with the character nor if the ending was an amicable one, nor if Jean will continue to work with Gwen Media in other roles than this one.

On Monday, July 16, 2007, the Rubberella.com website was suspended by Gwenmedia management.  As of November 2008, there has been no formal word from management on any possible restart of this series at some undefined later time.

=== New Gwenmedia formally restarts &quot;Ivy Manor&quot; series ===

Gwenmedia has announced that its original series &quot;Ivy Manor&quot; will be available for public screening on Wednesday, November 28, 2007.  This restart of the series marks the formal restart of the film production of the original production series of Gwenmedia.  The new film &quot;Ivy Manor 5: Rubber Dreams&quot; is a re-imagining of the original AVN award winning version &quot;Ivy Manor 5: Teacher's Pet&quot; as if the original series storyline had been continued by John Fitzgerald.

The recent film entitled &quot;Ivy Manor Slaves&quot; released by the new Gwenmedia was not part of this series, despite having the same story writer/director (John Fitzgerald) and primary performer (Jewell Marceau).  

=== AVN Awards ===

On November 25, 2007, the AVN Awards committee announced that &quot;Ivy Manor Slaves&quot; was nominated for &quot;2008 AVN Awards Best Speciality film-BDSM&quot;.[http://www.avnawards.com/pdf/2008Nominations.pdf]  This film did not win the category.

On November 26, 2008, the AVN Awards committee announced that John Fitzgerald's &quot;Ivy Manor 5: Rubber Dreams&quot; and Julie Simone's &quot;Slavery: A Love Story&quot; produced for Sinclaire's Gwen Media were both nominated for &quot;2009 AVN Awards Best BD/SM Release&quot;.[http://avnawards.com/pdf/2009_AVN_NOMINATIONS_11_25_08.pdf]  Neither of these films won the category.  The winner was &quot;House of Sex and Domination&quot; from Private

The formal Ivy Manor Gwen Media series was also nominated for &quot;2009 AVN Awards Best Speciality series&quot;.  This series did not win.  The winner was &quot;Taboo&quot; from Hustler.

=== Jean Bardot starts own production ===

With a new public announcement made on November 14, 2007, Jean Bardot has stated she is completely separate from Gwenmedia and will begin releasing her own films from her own production company. Bardot released her first film entitled Medimorphe in May 2008.  There was no mention if Jean would ever work with Gwenmedia in any form at all in the future. While Jean is a directly competiting producer to Gwenmedia now, several other performers who work with Gwenmedia also release their own film products separate from Gwenmedia though in the same fetish idea, including Jewell Marceau and Anastasia Pierce. Thus it remains to be seen if Jean will work with Gwenmedia in the future.  

It should be noted that Batdot's picture has remained on the entry page of the website during the entire removal of Bardot from the Rubberella character, and afterwards.  In fact Bardot image remains as the initial &quot;face&quot; of the Gwen Media website as of June 2009.

=== Sinclaire announced she is closing Gwen Media ===

On November 14, 2008, Isabella posted an announcement on her public website that she intends to end her dominatrix career to &quot;pursue other avenues&quot; which remain unspecified.[http://www.dominationonline.com/newsletter/Oct08/IVYnewsOct08.html]  In line with her on-screen persona as a dominatrix, Sinclaire has stated she is ending her online websites and both Ivy Manor Videos and Gwen Media.  In August 2009, Sinclaire stated she is leaving her established base in Los Angeles.[http://www.isabellasinclaire.com/blog/static.php?page=static090306-214702]
It was not stated if she sold her Los Angeles studios.

Sinclaire has not clearly stated if she merely will end Gwen Media or sell it off to someone else to continue.

As of August 2009, there has been no recant from Sinclaire on her publicly stated decision to end her webcompanies' production.  However, Sinclaire has yet to announce a specified date of closure either.  Thus it remains unclear what will be Gwen Media's last day of operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mystique Magazine''' is an Austin, TX based glamour company, founded in 1998. The company features “women you could spend the rest of your life with.&quot;  

Most of its photo shoots and productions are done in exotic locations. The photos, most of them shot by Mark Daughn, are more about creating a mood or a feeling in an image, and not about how explicit or revealing it can be.  The company features a variety of models. There is no “cookie-cutter” formula. Some popular well known models featured in Mystique include [[Linda O'Neil]], [[Erica Campbell]], [[Aria Giovanni]] and [[Sunny Leone]]. Some of the company's own popular discoveries include [[Katia Corriveau]], [[Aurora Vaillantcourt]] and [[Deanna Merryman]].

Mystique Magazine publishes hardcover coffee-table books, a web site, and a range DVDs and wall calendars. In 2004, the company also began producing original television programming for North America’s top Pay Per View networks, such as [[inDemand]] and [[Dish Network]].

'''Kink.com''' is a [[San Francisco]]-based [[internet pornography]] company that runs a group of [[websites]] devoted to [[BDSM]] and related [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]].

==Hogtied.com==
Kink.com was started by UK-native [[Peter Acworth]] in 1997 while he was a PhD student in [[finance]] at [[Columbia University]]. After reading a story in a British [[tabloid]] about a fireman who made 250 thousand [[pound sterling|pounds]] in a short period by starting an internet pornography site, Acworth decided to start a porn site of his own. Since Acworth had what he described as a lifelong interest in bondage, he oriented the site toward BDSM porn.&lt;ref name=Mooallem&gt; [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/magazine/29kink.t.html &quot;A Disciplined Business&quot;] by Jon Mooallem, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]],'' April 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The site was called Hogtied.com and initially featured content that was licensed from other primary producers. The site was successful, and the site was soon grossing several thousand dollars per day. Acworth soon left his graduate studies to work on the site full time.&lt;ref name=Mooallem/&gt;

==Move to San Francisco==
In 1998, Acworth moved the company from [[New York City]] to [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=Mooallem/&gt; Finding that sales were leveling off because other sites were using the same content, Acworth began producing his own content, initially featuring himself with various models who he found through [[Craigslist]] or through his photographer friends.&lt;ref name=Mooallem/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.7x7sf.com/people/profiles/3545792.html &quot;The New Pornographers&quot;] by Robin Rinaldi, ''7x7'', August 01, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the company's second site, [[Fucking machines|Fucking Machines]], in 2000,&lt;ref name=VillageVoice&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-07-16/columns/the-man-behind-the-fucking-machine/&quot; The Man Behind the Fucking Machines&quot;], ''[[Village Voice]],'' July 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. and has since opened fourteen additional subscription websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.behindkink.com/blog/default/2008/02/01/Kink-com-Celebrates-its-10-year-Anniversary &quot;Kink.com Celebrates its 10 Year Anniversary&quot;], ''Behind Kink'', February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several websites under the '''Kink.com''' umbrella feature directors that relocated following the demise of [[Insex]] as a result of US government pressure in 2005, but offer more of a focus on consensuality than Insex was known for.

In late 2006, Kink.com purchased the [[San Francisco Armory]] for $14.5 million, for use as a production studio.  A group known as the Mission Armory Community Collective formed to oppose Kink.com's use of the building and  in early February 2007 held a public protest in front of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooallem&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt; [http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_d=3027&amp;catid=4 &quot;Kink hearing: The pornographer's purchase of the Armory faces more roadblocks&quot;] by Deborah Giattina, ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'', March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents of the [[Mission District]] were disturbed by Kink.com's purchase of the [[San Francisco Armory]], feeling that a pornography studio should not be located in the middle of a residential neighborhood near schools or that the site should have been used for low-income housing or other community-oriented uses.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt; [http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=3027&amp;catid=4 &quot;Kink hearing: The pornographer's purchase of the Armory faces more roadblocks&quot;] by Deborah Giattina, ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'', March 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lagos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=sfgtv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/02/02/national/a105718S92.DTL &quot;Porn Studio Puts City in a Kink&quot;] by Lisa Leff, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, there were plans to destroy part of the structure to accommodate condominium development.  Ironically, the condo plan's changing of the integrity of the building created supporters who welcomed Kink.com's use of The Armory as a way of revitalizing the structure and bringing back business to the area without altering the appearance of the historic building, as well as being in keeping with San Francisco's tradition of accommodating [[sexual minorities]].&lt;ref name=sfgtv&gt; [http://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=20&amp;clip_id=3256 &quot;San Francisco Planning Commission - Special Public Hearing&quot;], ''SFGTV'', March 8, 2007. (link to streaming [[Windows Media]] video and downloadable [[MP3]] audio)&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] also expressed concern over the Kink.com purchase, and scheduled a special meeting of the San Francisco Planning Commission in March 2007 to review the company's use of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mooallem&quot; /&gt; The meeting was well-attended by both supporters and detractors of the Kink.com purchase. The Planning Commission for its part ruled that Kink.com was not in violation of any law or [[zoning]] requirement.&lt;ref name=bar&gt; [http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=1648 &quot;Planning Commission hears Kink.com case&quot;] by Liz Highleyman, ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/13/BAG0INI8PD1.DTL|title=Ex-armory turns into porn site|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lagos&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/26/BAG5RNPKIV1.DTL  No welcome mat for adult film studio&quot;] by Marisa Lagos, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', January 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kink.com has stated that its activities would be invisible to the surrounding neighborhood, La Casa de las Madres, a neighboring [[women's shelter]], announced that they would be leaving the location because of the media scrutiny of Kink.com's presence.&lt;ref&gt; [http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/03/26/story12.html| &quot;Service organization flees from kinky Mission neighbor&quot;] by Sarah Duxbury, ''San Francisco Business Times'', March 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the company's website [[Fucking machines|Fucking Machines]] was involved in a [[trademark]] dispute when the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] refused to grant a trademark for the name of the site, asserting that it was obscene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/features/story.asp?id=11596|title=THE F BOMB  |last=Jeffrey C. Billman|date=2007-06-07|work=Orlando Weekly|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online streaming==
In 2007, the company began streaming regular live shows, in part as a defense against [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://news.cnet.com/2100-1026_3-6172180.html &quot;At Kink.com, A Live Tool Against Piracy&quot;], ''CNet News'', March 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; One Kink.com bondage site, Device Bondage, now streams monthly live shows,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=97914 &quot;Trina Michaels to Appear Live on DeviceBondage.com&quot;], ''XBiz'', August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and erotic wrestling site Ultimate Surrender began streaming its competitive matches live in 2008.&lt;ref&gt; [http://avn.com/internet/articles/31837.html &quot;Ultimate Surrender Streams 3 Matches Live&quot;], ''Adult Video News'', August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the company added on-demand technology to its websites, selling updates to their websites on a per-episode basis rather than strictly by subscription.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.avn.com/internet/articles/31643.html &quot;Kink.com Launches Kink On Demand&quot;], ''Adult Video News'', August 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This system recently began adding third-party content, including that from Germany's [[Marquis (magazine)|Marquis]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://avn.com/internet/articles/31860.html &quot;Kink.com Partners With Germany's Marquis&quot;], ''Adult Video News'', August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The company's most recently launched site is BoundGods.com, a gay bondage site directed by [[Van Darkholme]]. Bound Gods was launched under a new gay-focused division, KinkMen.com.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.avn.com/gay/articles/31575.html &quot;Kink.com Launches First Gay Bondage Site&quot;], ''Adult Video News'', August 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2008, Kink.com was nominated for a 2009 AVN Award in a new category, Best Adult Website.&lt;ref&gt; [http://avnawards.com/pdf/2009_AVN_NOMINATIONS_11_25_08.pdf &quot;Complete 2009 AVN Awards Nominee List&quot;], ''AVNAwards.com'', November 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over the identity of Abby Winters==
Abby Winters is an Internet persona. 'Her' first writings to [[usenet]] are from 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://groups.google.fi/groups/profile?enc_user=TtwkqhgAAAAZEx-lIIUtvcAIhjrHPzYeoyiJbVXW1IrsQYQCtqYpsA&amp;hl=fi usenet profile]: See details in articles [[Talk:Abbywinters.com#Fictional|talkpage]]&lt;/ref&gt; Abby insists in print interviews that she is a real person, but is now removed from the day-to-day operations of the business.&lt;ref&gt;Adult DVD Talk, October 2007, [http://www.adultdvdtalk.com/talk/abby-winters.asp Abby Winters interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's official [[folklore]] says that it was founded for fun, launched October 14, 2000, by a photographer, Abby Winters (born December 13, 1974), and her web-designer friend, who observed how poor existing sites were and thought that she could do better.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutabby&quot;&gt;Abby Winters, [http://www.abbywinters.com/main.php?page=AboutAbby About Abby, her ideas, and her gear]&lt;/ref&gt; Around May 2002 Abby left to &quot;pursue other interests&quot; and Garion Hall became owner and operator of the website.  Abby Winters does regular interviews and writings, but only does them in print,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eros-la.com/articles/2007-12-11/abbywinters121107/ Abby Winters interview]&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no record of her appearing at any trade shows or events. 

In the early years of the site, Abby was credited as the main photographer; as of November 2006, she was using a [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II|Canon EOS-1D Mark IIN]] [[digital camera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutabby&quot; /&gt;

The suggestion that Abby Winters is a woman has been disputed, with some suggesting that the name is in fact a pseudonym of (male) CEO Garion Hall.&lt;ref name=bb1&gt;[http://forums.abbywinters.com/vbulletin/showthread.php?p=210593#post210593 Abby Winters bulletin board] retrieved 27 December, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gp1&gt;[http://www.gramponante.com/2008/01/cultural-learnings-of-abby-winters.html Cultural Learnings of Abby Winters] retrieved 27 December, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fb1&gt;[http://fleshbot.com/5108242/who-is-abby-winters Who is Abby Winters?]  retrieved 27th December, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fb2&gt;[http://fleshbot.com/5115517/abby-winters-scandalwatch-the-plot-thickens Abby Winters Scandalwatch: The Plot Thickens!]  retrieved 27 December, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=liandra&gt;Liandra Dahl, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071206153648/http://liandradahl.blogspot.com/2007/06/liandra-lets-loose.html]{{Wayback|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abby's identity has been a frequent and contentious topic of discussion on abbywinters.com's own discussion board.&lt;ref name=bb1/&gt; Since abbywinters.com's appearance at the 2008 [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo]],&lt;ref name=avn2008&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GadgetGuide/story?id=4117881&amp;page=1 ABC News: Porn Stars Shine in Sin City] retrieved 29 December, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; journalists covering the adult industry have published articles which express scepticism about Abby's identity (often coupled with praise for the site's content);&lt;ref name=gp1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fb1/&gt; these have culminated in the adult news site [[Fleshbot]] publishing a photograph of Mr Hall wearing an &quot;Abby&quot; nametag and taking photographs at a 2007 shoot at which &quot;Abby Winters&quot; was the credited photographer.&lt;ref name=fb2/&gt;&lt;ref name=yoga&gt; [http://girl-girl.abbywinters.com/main.php?page=profile&amp;model=2022 Abby Winters - Yoga Shoot] retrieved 27 December, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a model who participated in the photoshoot mentioned Hall by name as the photographer in a post on the website's forum, although this reference was later removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;fb1&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism by Liandra Dahl==
In 2007, ex-Abby Winters model Liandra Dahl wrote on her blog about privacy problems concerning G-Media sites, which was picked up by the ''[[Herald Sun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl is concerned that Abby Winters fails to inform young and inexperienced models on how their involvement in pornography might revisit them and inhibit their future choices, in the sense that content may be available outside of the confines of the paysite and be available in [[file sharing]] networks. As of May 2008, it remains extremely easy to obtain images and videos of virtually all featured models, including from the, &quot;Members-Only-shoots,&quot; through a range of free sources.&lt;ref name=liandra/&gt;

== Police raid on G Media ==
According to the [[Herald Sun]] newspaper, on 16 June 2009, G-Media offices in Melbourne were raided by [[Victoria Police]] as part of a wider &quot;Operation Refuge&quot;. The Herald Sun article gives two grounds for the raid: that G-Media may have filmed an under-age model, and that G-Media's DVD productions may have contravened [[Censorship in Australia|Victoria's film classification laws]].&lt;ref name=hun&gt;{{cite web

G Media later released a statement stating that nothing had been seized in the raid, and that the police were polite and amiable throughout.&lt;ref name=some2&gt;

The '''Exotic Erotic Ball'''&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (often referred to as &quot;The Ball&quot; or &quot;Perry Mann's Exotic Erotic Ball&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exoticeroticball.com/&lt;/ref&gt;) is held annually around [[Halloween]] time (usually the weekend before Halloween Night) in the [[San Francisco Bay]] area of [[California]] and is the longest-running public adult-themed event in the world. The annual indoor event has become a major attraction in the [[San Francisco Bay]] and has been attended by nearly half a million people since its inception with steadily increasing growth in attendance each year. Due to the worldwide popularity of the event the City of [[San Francisco]] has issued three proclamations for “Exotic Erotic Ball Day”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56325487.html San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Has Proclaimed Saturday, October 23rd 'Exotic Erotic Ball Day' in San Francisco!!!&lt;/ref&gt;, twice by Mayor [[Willie Lewis Brown, Jr.|Willie Brown]] in 1999 and again in 2001, and once by Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] in 2004.

Many attendees of the Exotic Erotic Ball come to the event in wildly elaborate, creative, and sexy [[Halloween costume]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/28/BAJBT2D25.DTL&amp;feed=rss.bayarea Acres of fishnet and flesh at Exotic Erotic Ball&lt;/ref&gt; to compete in the annual “Best Costume” contest&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urbannetwork.com/cms/index.php?news=1092 The Ball's World Famous Costume Contests&lt;/ref&gt; which typically awards the winner with prize money and merchandise in the $10,000 USD range. 

While the Exotic Erotic Ball by definition would be considered a “[[Festival]]” the event is rarely categorized into conventional terms by attendees, the media, or event organizers. Because of the broad spectrum of conventional and [[unconventional]] entertainment offered on multiple stages at the Exotic Erotic Ball, it may be best described as a bizarre combination of Adult-themed; Halloween festival, [[Music Festival]], [[Burlesque]] show, [[Lingerie party]], [[Masquerade ball]], [[Fetish club]], [[Swingers party]] and [[Adult Industry]] [[Trade Show]].

In 2004, organizers expanded the Exotic Erotic Ball to include the [[Exotic Erotic Expo]]. The [[Exotic Erotic Expo]] is a two-day Adult-Expo typically held the day before and the day of the Exotic Erotic Ball. The [[Exotic Erotic Expo]] activities include panel discussions on [[First Amendment rights]] with [[adult actress]], actors, and media, [[wine tasting]]s with [[porn stars]], and various oddities such as the &quot;spiritual oasis&quot; with psychic readings and massage, [[body painting]], a classic [[adult cinema]], and a human petting zoo. The Exotic Erotic Expo also features a commercial area with [[vendors]] and exhibitors who showcase the latest in exotic fashion, [[erotic art]], adult products, games, websites, and adult novelties. 

In 2008; 26,341 people participated in the combined Exotic Erotic Ball and [[Exotic Erotic Expo]].

== History ==

Perry Mann organized the first Exotic Erotic Ball in 1979 to raise campaign funds for his buddy, the late [[Louis Abolafia]], who ran for President of the United States under the [[Nudist Party]] with the slogan: “I have nothing to hide.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exoticeroticball.com/about.php History of the Exotic Erotic Ball&lt;/ref&gt; Louis also coined the phrase, [[Make love, not war|“Make love, not war!”]] and his legendary [[Greenwich Village]] love-ins inspired the New York press to crown him “The Love King.”  Abolafia had previously run in 1968 under the Cosmic Love Party, even then with the slogan &quot;What have I got to hide?&quot;
 
The Nudist Ball, a precursor to the Exotic Erotic Ball, took place in Mann's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California]] apartment in 1978 and attracted a few hundred people. In 1979, it moved to California Hall on Turk Street and officially became the Exotic Erotic Ball, with 800 to 900 people paying $10 apiece.
 
The location changed over the years ending up at its current home at the [[Cow Palace]]. Attendance to the Exotic Erotic Ball averages 15,000 annually with 20,000 attending in 2005.

The Exotic Erotic Ball has also fostered strong ties to the community. Over the years, the Ball has distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urbannetwork.com/cms/index.php?news=1092 Exotic Erotic Ball and Snoop Dogg Combine to Raise Funds for The Healing Circle&lt;/ref&gt; supporting causes such as helping the victims of natural disasters&lt;ref&gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NXkOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=goEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6826,8007921&amp;dq=exotic-erotic-ball Earthquake-rattled San Francisco returning to abnormal&lt;/ref&gt;, AIDS&lt;ref&gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NXkOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=goEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6826,8007921&amp;dq=exotic-erotic-ball&lt;/ref&gt;, homelessness, domestic violence, child abuse, and has always supported freedom of expression and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] Rights. The Exotic Erotic Ball hosts an annual blood drive with Blood Centers of the Pacific. 

Perry Mann: “My late partner's Louis' expression ‘Make Love, Not War' was once the rallying cry of a generation,” adds Perry Mann. “I don't think that message has ever been more timely or important than it is today, and I don't think our show has ever been a more needed diversion.”

== Trivia ==
* Although it is billed as a [[San Francisco, California]] event, the ball is technically held in [[Daly City, California]] where the [[Cow Palace]] is located.
* In 2004, Republican legislators in California—countering a move to outlaw gun shows at the Cow Palace—sought to ban the ball as well. They lost. (May 2004)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/5/20/150948.shtml, retrieved September 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Technically, [[Public nudity]] is not allowed at the ball but there's always a selected few who do not abide by that rule and, not surprisingly, you won’t see anyone enforcing it.
* In 2001, Mann released the book ''The Exotic Erotic Ball: Twenty Years of the World's Sexiest Party'' (ISBN 156171917X).

'''Amateur Teen Kingdom''' or '''ATKingdom''' is a popular [[United States|American]]-based [[Pornographic film|pornographic]] website and adult entertainment company, featuring amateur, coed, exotic and petite female models. They are also renown in the industry for their natural and hairy female fetish models.&lt;ref&gt;http://hairy.amkingdom.com/02/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ATKingdom.com''' is ranked in the top 10,000 visited websites in the world according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] traffic rankings &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/www.atkingdom.com ATKingdom Alexa Rankings&lt;/ref&gt; and is an approved title sponsor of the [[Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP)]].&lt;ref name=asacp&gt;{{cite web

|title=ASACP Title Sponsor}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
'''ATKingdom.com''' was established in [[1996]] as a free adult site portal. After generating significant and financially profitable traffic for other adult websites, the company created a [[Paysite|paid]] members adult site of their own in [[1997]]. Their first site launched was titled '''ATK Galleria''', which focused on coed, babe and amateur female models. 

After establishing a natural and hairy section on '''ATK Galleria''', the company expanded to a new separate paid member site titled '''ATK Natural and Hairy'''. The natural and hairy site is one of the few and arguably most famous hairy model fetish sites on the net.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebestporn.com/review/atknaturalhairy/ The Best Porn Review&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur Teen Kingdom continued to expand with other [[Paysite|paid]] membership sites including '''ATK Exotics''', '''ATK Archives''' and '''ATK Premium'''. In [[2009]], the company released their newest site '''ATK Petites''', which is notable because it only features models that are under 5'4&quot; and less then 110&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;http://tour.atkpetites.com/01/ ATK Petites&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In [[2007]], '''ATKingdom''' was nominated for their first ever [[AVN Award]]. It wasn't until [[2009]], when they won their first [[AVN Award|award]] from [[AVN (magazine)|AVN]] in the category of ''Best Amateur Release'' for their [[DVD]] titled '''ATK Exotics Volume 2''' ''Amateur Asian Angels''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avnawards.com/index.php?center=meet-the-winners2 2009 AVN Award Winners&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[pornographic movies]] are [[economy|economic]] activities of some importance. The exact size of the economy of pornography and the influence that it plays in political circles are matters of controversy. In many countries pornography is legal to distribute and to produce; however there are often restrictions placed upon it. [[Pornography]] is also banned in some countries, in particular in the [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Muslim world]], but can be accessed through the [[Internet]].

==Americas==
===Canada===
Hardcore material is legal in Canada to anyone over the age of majority (18 or 19, depending on the province). Sales to persons under 18 (or 19) is prohibited, though persons of this age may own or possess porn. Most materials are sold in [[adult bookstore|adult stores]] or on [[adult website|adult websites]]. No specific law exists controlling distribution. The [[Canada Border Services Agency]] is empowered to stop the importation of materials prohibited under [[obscenity]] laws; many [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] bookstores have charged that this is applied in a discriminatory manner against same-sex pornographic materials. Conversely, some over-the-air [[television station|television stations]] (particularly [[Citytv]] and [[TQS]]) often broadcast softcore pornographic films after midnight. Hardcore films also air on [[MExcess]], one of the seven [[multiplex]] channels operated by [[The Movie Network]]. In addition, pornographic films may be publicly shown (to those above the age of 18) and advertised, as is the case in some stores on [[Yonge Street]] in [[Toronto]] and Ste-Catherine Street in Montreal.

{{Main|Child pornography laws in Canada}}
It is illegal for a person under the age of 18 to appear in any pornographic film produced in Canada, regardless of whether such participation constitutes a sexual act.

=== Latin America ===
In [[Latin America]], the pornography industry is somewhat limited. However, pornography is abundant, especially pirate DVDs from the USA and Europe, which are present on the streets of most capitals in Latin America. Regulations on the [[Brazil|Brazilian]] industry include: mandatory use of [[condom|condoms]] in penetration scenes; all actors in pornographic films must be 18 or older; regular pornography (not involving bestiality/snuff) is legal when sold in public places; [[magazine]] and DVD covers that depict genitalia must be hidden from public view; and pornography can only be sold to people 18 or older (though enforcement of this law is generally lax).

Child pornography or its production, distribution, or possession is illegal in Brazil.

In the last 10-15 years, numerous American and European actors such as [[Rocco Siffredi]], [[Nacho Vidal]], and [[John Stagliano]] have visited Brazil to produce movies which, like most American pornographic productions, are shot without condoms (contrary to native laws requiring them). Brazil is also well-known for [[gay]] and [[transsexual]] pornography, though [[Argentina]] is emerging as another source for transsexual porn, with several titles already produced by major American companies (e.g., [[Anabolic]]). Argentina is also widely used to shoot pornographic clips straight for the Internet, as well as for photoshoots. Films shot in Argentina typically have the male performers wearing condoms.

Allegedly, actor [[Darren James]] contracted [[H.I.V.]] after shooting a scene in Brazil with actress Bianca Biaggi.

Other countries commonly visited by American companies involve [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]. In Mexico, it is illegal to sell or show pornography to children under 18 years of age. Enforcement is lax. Magazines or [[comic books]] featuring softcore (and some hardcore) pornography are commonly sold in newsstands.  Several other movies were produced by the European company Private in [[Costa Rica]] in the 1990’s. The American companies Anabolic and [[Diabolic]] produced several Latin based series such as [[Panochitas]], which included trips to places such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Chile]].

===United States===
{{Main article|Pornography in the United States}}

Publication of hardcore material is only illegal at the federal (national) level if it meets the [[Miller test]] of [[obscenity]], which is rare.

In the [[United States]], distribution of pornography changed radically after the 1980s, with [[videotape|VHS]] and [[cable television]] largely displacing X-rated theaters. Video distribution, in turn, is in the process of being replaced by [[DVD]], and by Internet distribution for [[niche markets]]). Distribution of pornography is a large industry that involves major entertainment companies such as [[Time Warner]], which profits from pornography through its cable channels and in-room movies in hotels.

Producing [[child pornography]] involving actual children (defined as someone under the age of 18 years) engaged in sex acts, or posing in an obscene manner, is a [[crime]] on the federal level punishable by a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 40 years; this makes U.S. law on child porn some of the harshest in the world. Recently, obscenity laws have been used in the [[Dwight Whorley]] case to convict for possessing illustrations of children engaged in sexual acts. The law against simulated child pornography was struck down by the [[Supreme Court]] in 2002 in the case [[Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition]]; however, this opinion seems to have been superseded by the adoption of the [[PROTECT Act of 2003]]. Prosecution for, and tolerance of, pornography varies widely from state to state and city to city. Certain materials and/or acts have been self-regulated out of mainstream porn. Pornographic materials may not be made available to persons under 18 years of age. Some attempts at restricting pornography on the [[Internet]] have been made, but most have been struck down by the courts.

While child pornography is illegal, photographs of [[nudist]] children are not, creating some confusion as to where the legal line is drawn.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/01/31/kincaid/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the porn industry has also begun using software to de-age porn actors, allowing films to seem as if they have younger performers while still adhering to strict child pornography laws. {{fact|date=February 2009}}

Pornography generates billions of dollars in sales in the [[United States]] alone, and economists have suggested that it has now reached the point where the outlawing of the industry, which has been tried on occasion, could have a major negative economic impact. An outright ban, it is feared, might spark a rise in [[organized crime]] similar to that during [[Prohibition]].

An estimated 211 new pornographic films are made every week in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,947880,00.html With pot and porn outstripping corn, America's black economy is flying high], [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==
{{main|European pornography}}
[[Europe|European]] hardcore pornography is dominated by a few pan-European producers and distributors, the most notable of which is the [[Private Media Group]]. Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from [[Portugal]] (''Naturalvideo'') to [[Romania]] (''Floyd-Agency''), all of which compete with larger, international organizations with varying levels of success. 

The once popular style of Euro-chic pornography created by directors [[Lasse Braun]], [[Joe d'Amato]], and [[Jean Rollin|Michel Gentil]] has lost ground and the [[Pierre Woodman]] style of video porn now attracts a larger audience. A few directors like [[Luca Damiano]], [[Mario Salieri]], and [[Alain Payet]] have continued with the &quot;older&quot; cinematographic and dramatic styles that often distinguish ''European'' pornography from that of other cultures. 

Throughout Europe, ostensibly private &quot;stolen&quot; [[Celebrity sex tape|videos, featuring celebrities]] having sex, are very popular on the Internet and in the [[black market]]. It is unclear whether these videos were truly released without their participants' permission, or whether they constitute a type of [[publicity stunt]] planned by the principals themselves, most of whom are TV and music stars. In recent years, starting with the [[Severina Vučković]] &quot;incident&quot; in 2004, the country of [[Croatia]] has seen an explosion of these videos, causing a [[phenomenon]] of imitation by teenagers.

Many U.S.-based pornography websites distribute primarily European pornography, or porn which features actresses from primarily [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] countries. These actresses (often advertised as &quot;Eurobabes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurobabeindex.com | title=Eurobabeindex | accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;) may conform more to a look usually seen in U.S. actresses than European ones, although they may still be considered to look &quot;more natural&quot; (European pornography typically de-emphasizes [[breast implant|breast implants]], among other aesthetic factors). 

=== Austria ===
&quot;Youth-imperiling&quot; materials or those which violate [[human dignity]] may not be displayed or sold to persons under 16 years of age. [[Nudity]] does not fall under this restriction.

=== [[Bulgaria]] ===
Technically, production or distribution of pornography in Bulgaria is a crime. However, there is no clear difference between pornography and erotica. Authorities tolerate distribution of hardcore porn in designated shops, and on TV after 11 pm. Hardcore pornographic material may not be sold to persons under the age of 18. Softcore material is rarely censored. Magazines and pornographic papers have become increasingly available since the fall of [[communism]] in 1989, and local editions of many international porn magazines are published.

In general, only child pornography is prosecuted.

=== [[Denmark]] ===
A ban on pornographic literature was lifted in 1967. In 1969, Denmark became the first country in the world to legalize pornography. People in Denmark have free access to pornography; it is sold in most [[convenience stores]], and is available for purchase or rental in practically every video store, including [[Blockbuster Video|Blockbuster]]. There are a few regulations: for example, pornography must be placed out of the eyesight of children, and it may not be sold to persons under the age of 15. The TV channel [[Kanal København]] broadcasts hardcore pornography free and uncoded at night.

There are no specific restrictions against animal pornography; such affairs come under [[animal cruelty]] laws. If no harm or pain has been inflicted on the animal, such acts are legal. This lack of legislation has allegedly made Denmark a center for the production of animal pornography. This accusation, however, was dismissed as a [[urban legend|myth]] by [[Det Dyreetiske Råd]], a legal council, which in November 2006 published an extensive report on the topic of animal sex.[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Pressemeddelelser2006/d.pdf]

Since 1980, child pornography has been illegal in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Section 234 of the ''Danish Criminal Code'' (1969), reads whoever 'sells indecent pictures or objects to a person under 16 yrs of age' is to be punished by a fine. Section 235 (1980) has a special provision concerning the reproduction and sale of child pornography, that is, sexually explicit photographs of persons who appear to be under 15 years (the taking of such pictures was always a criminal offence).&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to distribute photographic or video pornography to persons under the age of 18, although the [[age of consent]] in Denmark is 15. It is, however, not illegal to possess images or videos of people above 15 if such persons have given consent.

=== [[Finland]] ===
Child, violent and bestial pornography is banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 Strafflag, 17 KAP, 18 §]&lt;/ref&gt; It is legal to sell pornography in any store, but magazines may not be sold to buyers under 15 years of age, and hardcore is restricted to buyers 18 years or older.

Prior to 1 January 1999, all indecent publishing, including the import and export thereof, was banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/alkup/1927/19270023 Lag angående undertryckande av osedliga publikationers spridning]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[France]] ===
Extremely violent or graphic pornography is considered [[X-rated]], may be shown only in specific theaters, and may not be displayed to [[minor (law)|minors]]. Some pornography has a special [[value-added tax|VAT]]: a 33% tax is levied on X-rated movies, and a 50% excise is placed on pornographic online services. The ratings system has caused controversy; e.g., in 2000 the sexually explicit and violent ''[[Baise-moi]]'' was initially rated only as &quot;restricted&quot; by the French government. This classification was overturned by a ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' ruling in a lawsuit brought by associations supporting [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[family values]].

=== [[Germany]] ===
German law is very strict about hardcore pornography, especially when compared to very liberal laws about [[Softcore Pornography|softcore pornography]], [[prostitution]], and [[sex shops]]. Providing hardcore pornography to a person under 18 is illegal, and shops selling it must keep people under the age of 18 from entering their premises. If only a part of the shop is dedicated to pornography, it must be completely closed off from the rest of the premises. Alternatively, shops may choose not to display their goods or advertise that they sell them, in which case minors may be admitted. Websites hosting pornographic material within Germany must comply with very strict rules about verifying that viewers are over 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heise.de/newsticker/BGH-reicht-Check-der-Ausweisnummer-als-Zugangshuerde-fuer-Online-Pornos-nicht-aus--/meldung/97651&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has a very broad definition of child pornography, which includes images of all real or fictional people who either are under the age of 18 or who appear to be below 18 to an &quot;average viewer&quot;. Distribution of such material is prohibited, although possession is only banned if the material shows a real person below 18. Pornography involving violence or bestiality may not be produced or distributed, but is legal to possess.

=== [[Greece]] ===
Softcore magazines, calendars, and decks of cards are sold openly at roadside kiosks and tourist shops. Extreme or graphic pornography is generally restricted to adult stores or X-rated shops. While the law states that hardcore pornography is to be supplied only to adults, it is rarely enforced. There are no other restrictions to pornography distribution and possession.

=== [[Hungary]] ===
Pornography is illegal if sold or shown to children under 18 years of age. However, displaying the genitals openly, as on the cover of a magazine, is not prohibited.

=== [[Iceland]] ===
Publication of pornography is illegal in Iceland,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/1940019.html#G210 (Icelandic language) Icelandic general criminal code, article 210&lt;/ref&gt; and is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 6 months. Publication of child pornography is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 2 years.

=== [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] ===
Ireland has censorship boards with the power to ban the importation, sale, or distribution of individual publications and films. At one time, the official list of banned books ran into the thousands, though in recent years, and particularly since the mid 1990s, almost no publications or films have been banned, and those that were previously banned are now permitted. Pornograpic movies are restricted to viewers 18 and over.

Other than regulations regarding pornographic movies, no laws against pornography, other than child pornography (a child is defined as someone under 18), exist.

=== [[Italy]] ===
In Italy it is illegal to distribute pictoral or video pornography to persons under the age of 18. [[Hardcore pornography|Hardcore]] and [[softcore]] movies and magazines are available not only through sex shops, but also in normal video stores, newsstands, and even some gas stations. By law, the seller is required to ask for [[Identity document|proof of age]] if he suspects the buyer to be under the legal age for purchasing pornography. This restriction does not apply to certain softcore adult magazines (i.e. [[Playboy]]); nevertheless, an unspoken practice of not selling this kind of material to buyers under the age of 16 is observed by Italian news vendors.

Pornographic material depicting actors under the age of 18 is classified as child pornography, and is strictly forbidden. Minors cannot give legal consent to appear in pornographic productions of any kind, even though the [[ages of consent in Europe#Italy|age of consent in Italy]] varies from 14 to 16 years.

The legal status of pornography itself is disputed in Italy. Technically, all production and distribution of pornography in the country is forbidden per Articles 528, 529, and 725 of the Italian Penal Code, which respectively sanction as felonies &quot;''Obscene publications and shows''&quot;, &quot;''Obscene activities and objects''&quot;, and &quot;''Commerce of publications, images or other objects offending public decency''&quot;. In the [[1980s]], several courts in Italy enforced these laws, ordering confiscation of pornographic material in their jurisdictions. At present, however, the enforcement of such laws is virtually non-existent. A new, more permissive interpretation of the law was introduced in the late 1980s as courts ruled that the Penal Code should be seen as protecting citizens' rights to not be exposed to such materials ''if and when they don't wish to be''. Thus, pornography was not to be considered illegal [[per se]], unless someone were to expose such materials to another against the latter's own will. Notwithstanding these rulings, a small number of towns in Italy have enacted municipal regulations banning sex shops within their boundaries.

Other forbidden porn material includes child porn and [[Snuff porn]]; contrary to common belief, [[zoophilia]] is not illegal, nor is [[BDSM]] or [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], though other types of acts such as [[necrophilia]] are. Most of these extreme practices, though, take place in [[Horror film|horror films]], which are not covered by statute, rather than strictly pornographic fare.

Despite the recent trend toward legalization of porn, distribution of pornographic video materials is almost totally restricted to the home video market. Relevant laws #23 of 6 August 1990 and #203 of 30 May 1995 forbid the broadcast of hardcore pornography on normal (&quot;open&quot;) [[television channels]], while such is legal on scrambled channels including [[Television in Italy#Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial television]] and [[Television in Italy#Satellite television|satellite television]]. Access to these channels and networks, many of which are [[pay-per-view]], requires a subscription and an [[Integrated receiver/decoder|IRD]], which normally features a [[Parental controls|parental control]] function to restrict access to given channels. It remains legal to broadcast erotic/softcore movies, videos and infomercials on unencrypted TV channels from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.

Providing or exposing pornography to minors under the age of 18 remains strictly forbidden.

=== [[Netherlands]] ===
In the Netherlands, a photograph or film of a sexual act involving or seemingly involving a minor (someone under age 18) is illegal. As of 2009, legislation was being considered that would ban pornography involving bestiality. Otherwise, Dutch law is permissive, and magazines and other print copy are sold openly at newsstands. Access to theaters showing softcore porn is restricted to those 16 and older; to theaters that show hardcore, one must be 18 to enter.

=== [[Norway]] ===
Hardcore material was illegal for years [[de jure]] to produce, distribute, or sell, but legal to possess. One could acquire it abroad, on the Internet, or via satellite TV. Illegal porn shops also existed, especially in larger cities.  To satisfy legal requirements, editors of erotic magazines, domestic TV channels, and cable TV obscured ''sexual organs in activity'' using black rectangles and the like. However, after the Dutch Supreme Court unanimously acquitted a former magazine editor on 7 December 2005 for publishing unobscured hardcore pornography in 2002, it became understood that printed hardcore pornography was no longer illegal. Pornographic magazines and movies were introduced in general stores in 2006. Regular and cable TV tend to abide by the old standards, and is not yet clear if the Supreme Court decision will affect television.

The depiction of illegal sexual activities, including those involving children, animals, necrophilia, rape, violence, or the use of force, remains illegal.&lt;!--Some references in Norwegian:--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/12/07/451567.html | title=Høyesterett sier ja til porno - Dagbladet.no | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1174004.ece | title=Porno-frifinnelse i Høyesterett | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/5301377.html | title=NRK.no - Kultur | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Illegal to show hardcore material on cable TV while satellite TV remains a grey area and graphically demonstrates the legal ambivalence Norway has towards hard pornography.

=== [[Poland]] ===
As of September 1998, Section 202 of the national Penal Code makes pornography legal except for the production or possession of pornographic materials containing minors, bestiality (zoophilia), and “scenes of violence/rape”. Also illegal is presenting or showing pornographic materials to people who do not want to have any contact with them, and to persons under 18 years of age. Pornographic magazines and movies are sold in transparent plastic bags openly in kiosks, gas stations, etc.

=== [[Romania]] ===
Pornography is legal in Romania. Magazines must be enclosed in plastic bags (or something equivalent) with a small red square printed on the enclosing material. Pornographic TV channels offered by cable operators must be encrypted. Pornographic materials cannot be sold to minors under 18. Also, porn actors and actresses must be at least 18 years of age.

=== [[Russia]] ===
{{seealso|Russian pornography and erotica}}
The legal status of pornography in Russia is uncertain. The law criminalizes only the 'illegal' production and selling of pornography (which implies that it sometimes can be legal), but two circumstances make enforcement of the law difficult: (1) the lack of a legal definition of pornography, and (2) no law defining when production or selling is legal.

In the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] period, the importation of pornography to the USSR was a [[death penalty|capital offense]]. [[Genrikh Yagoda]], the third head of the [[NKVD]], was accused during his trial (besides espionage and high treason) of storing a great number of pornographic films and pictures. Such accusations were also faced by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], who succeeded Yagoda.

Production, distribution, or public demonstration of child pornography (i.e., of children below 18 years of age) is a crime punishable by imprisonment. Possession of child porn is not a crime, if there is no intent to distribute or exhibit it.

=== [[Spain]] ===
Pornography in Spain is legal, and enforcement of obscenity laws is lax. It is illegal to display pornographic material at newsstands, but the great majority do so. In many city centers sex shops may be found. E-commerce merchants from all around the world use [[I.P.S.P.]] (Internet clearing services) from Spanish banks. The headquarters of [[Private Media Group]], Europe's biggest pornographic company, are in [[Barcelona]].

Pornography is forbidden in all forms to those under 18 years old.

=== [[Sweden]] ===
Sweden has no age laws for the possession or viewing of pornography. Some shops follow a voluntary limit and do not sell to minors. Material that involves animals is de facto legal, though it is subject to animal-welfare laws. BDSM is classified as an &quot;illegal depiction of violence,&quot; but the law is rarely enforced.

It is illegal for persons below the age of 18 to act in porn films or pose for obscene photography. Videos and pictures are illegal if they feature persons under 18, even if the material was legal in the originating country. 

=== [[Turkey]] ===
Turkey, which is a [[secular state]] with a Muslim majority, was the first country to produce pornographic materials in the [[Muslim world]]. After a long period of producing Italian-inspired softcore comedies in the 1970s, the hardcore film ''[[Öyle Bir Kadın Ki]]'' was distributed in 1979. Many more followed prior to the 1980 [[coup d'état]], when the government strictly prohibited graphic sex in cinema. In the late 1990s, Turkish pornography experienced a minor renaissance, producing cheap, low quality material. Modern producers of Turkish porn (e.g., [[Trimax]]) are centered in [[Germany]], though they still recruit their performers from Turkey. The most famous Turkish porn star is probably [[Şahin K]].{{fact|date=February 2009}} 

Beginning in 2004, the [[AKP]] government formulated legislation that, according to Article 226/II of the Turkish Penal Code, made it illegal to distribute &quot;obscene&quot; images, words, or texts through means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Article 226/II of the ''Turkish Penal Code'' [[2004]]. The penalty is imprisonment from 6 months to 3 years.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5237.html ''Türk Ceza Kanunu''] at the website of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further laws were passed restricting pornography later that year. In the province of [[Istanbul]], mayor [[Muammer Guler]] approved a bill banning all publicly displayed images, including advertisements, containing partial nudity such as swim suit ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nethaber.com/Ekonomi/21883/Istanbulda-fiilen-mayo-reklami-yasagi-uygulaniyormus

The channels were: Playboy TV, Exotica TV, Adult Channel, and Rogue TV. The ban was instituted by the Radio and Television High Council, on grounds that such programming violated Turkey's cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/05/06/turkey050506.html Turkish government bans porn channels] CBC. 06 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 2008, [[Edibe Sozen]], an AKP [[Member of Parliament|MP]], introduced a bill to ban the sales of pornographic images to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed bill also included a provision that anyone over 16 purchasing such materials would be registered in a database via a Citizen Identification Number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ulusalkanal.com.tr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8823&amp;Itemid=5

=== [[Ukraine]] ===

As of 30 June 2009, distribution and possession of pornography in Ukraine will result in a fine or a three year jail sentence. Porn that is only for medical purposes is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ronatvan.com/2009/07/02/-%E2%80%9Cmedicinal%E2%80%9D/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[United Kingdom]] ===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the main legislation on pornographic materials is the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]], the [[Obscene Publications Act 1964]], and the [[Indecent Displays Control Act 1981]]. Video-orientated depictions of hardcore material (with certain exceptions for works considered primarily 'artistic' rather than pornographic) were illegal until 1999, when the removal of trade barriers with other [[European Union]] member states allowed for the relatively free movement of such goods for personal use. [[R18 certificate|R18-rated]] videos are only available in licensed sex shops, but hardcore pornographic magazines are available in shops selling newspapers and magazines. In 2008, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] prosecuted a man under the Obscene Publications Act for a textual story on a pornography website involving [[Girls Aloud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/7649231.stm|title=Girls Aloud in 'murder' blog case|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also that year, the [[Home Office]] introduced legislation to criminalize possession of what it has labelled [[extreme pornography]]; these laws are now contained in sections 63 to 68 of the [[Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2008/ukpga_20080004_en_9#pt5-pb1-l1g63 Criminal Justice &amp; Immigration Act 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Child pornography is illegal (&quot;child&quot; is defined as a person under 18) to possess, produce (in terms of electronic copies), or to distribute, and is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment. In England and Wales, the law on this type of material is strictly defined by the [[Protection of Children Act 1978]], Section 160 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], further amended by the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] to include [[Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child|pseudo-photographs]], and the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which raised the age for appearing in pornographic material from 16 to 18 (while the age of consent in the UK remains 16). Sales of pornography is restricted to adults. In Scotland, similar provisions are to be found in sections 52 and 52A of the [[Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982]], which was also amended by the 1994 Act and by the [[Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005]].

==[[East Asia]]==
The three main producers of pornography in [[Asia]] are [[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Thailand]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Japan has a large pornography industry (see ''[[Pornography in Japan]]'') which features more natural looking women, usually wearing little makeup, servicing multiple men who tend to be anonymous. Women in some Asian pornography often act as if the sexual act was painful. In Japan, [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] pornography has a panoply of variations, ranging from well-known [[bukkake]] to [[tamakeri]]. Hong Kong and Thailand produce much print pornography, but less video. The men in Thai pornography tend to be younger than in Japanese or American porn. 

=== [[People's Republic of China|China]] ===
Internet pornography was outlawed in the People's Republic of China effective [[2002]], when state censors issued guidelines requiring all websites remove any pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since 2008, the production of pornographic movies has been banned by state censors, the [[State Administration of Radio, Film and Television|State Administration of Radio, Film and Television's]] prohibition on pornography has been complete, and the government has shown no signs of changing course. Directors, producers, and actors involved in pornographic movies have been barred from competing in any film competitions. Any [[movie studio]] found in violation may have its license revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this regulation and censorship, adult films and media can only obtained through the Internet and on the black market. Possession of pornography is punishable by up to 3 years in prison, a fine of 20,000 yuan, or even execution for large underground distributors. However, possession laws are very loosely enforced by the police and [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]], who mainly prosecute offenses based on political expediency.

=== [[Hong Kong]] ===
In Hong Kong, pornography is illegal if sold or shown to children under 18 years of age, if it is publicly displayed (except within the confines of and only visible from inside a &quot;bona fide art gallery or museum&quot;), or if it is sold without being wrapped completely with an &quot;easily noticeable&quot; warning stating that the material may be offensive and may not be distributed to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/BLIS_Export.nsf/CurAllEngDocAgent?OpenAgent&amp;Chapter=390 | title=Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Main article|Pornography in Japan}}
As in Europe, photographs of nudes are not uncommon in the mainstream media. In the 1970s and 1980s, the strongest prohibition was against showing pubic hair or adult genitalia. Imported magazines would have the pubic hair scratched out, and even the most explicit videos could not portray it. Starting around 1991, photobook publishers began challenging this ban to the point where pubic hair is now fairly well accepted. Close-ups of genitalia remain proscribed. In 1999, the government enacted a law banning photos and videos of naked children, which were a fairly common sight in mainstream media before that time. [[Manga]] and [[anime]] remain largely unregulated, although large publishers tend to self-censor (which is rare if compared to the [[United States]], as nudity is more accepted in Japan) or specify that characters are at least 18 years of age.

The 1960s, in Japanese pornography, was the era of the independent ''[[Pink film]]''. In the years since the end of [[World War II]], eroticism had been gradually making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film-- discreetly half-hidden by an umbrella-- caused a national sensation in [[1946 in film|1946]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=18 (Naked Dissent)|page=602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel &quot;stag films,&quot; made illegally by underground film producers such as those depicted in [[Shohei Imamura|Imamura]]'s film ''[[The Pornographers]]'' ([[1966 in film|1966]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Erotic Nightmares&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/focus_takechi.shtml|first=Jasper|last=Sharp|title=Tetsuji Takechi: Erotic Nightmares|accessdate=2007-04-19|work=www.midnighteye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nudity and sex would officially enter the Japanese cinema with the independent, low-budget softcore pornographic films which would come to dominate domestically-produced films in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-04-19|last=Domenig|first=Roland|year=2002|quote=Since the mid-1960s, pink eiga have been the biggest Japanese film genre...

In [[1964 in film|1964]] [[Tetsuji Takechi]] made the first big-budget, mainstream ''pink film'', ''[[Daydream (1964 film)|Daydream]]''. Takechi would remake ''Daydream'' as Japan's first theatrical hardcore film in [[1981 in film|1981]], starring [[Kyoko Aizome]]. 

Future &quot;Nikkatsu Queens&quot; [[Kazuko Shirakawa]] and [[Naomi Tani]] both made their debuts in 1967. Both actresses would appear in many ''pink films'' in the 1960s before beginning their work with [[Nikkatsu]] in the 1970s, for which they best known today.&lt;ref&gt; Weisser, p.333&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1960s, Naomi Tani was already known as the &quot;Queen of Pink.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Konuma, Masaru. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser on November 6, 1998, in ''Asian Cult Cinema'', #22, 1st Quarter, 1999. p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s was the era of big-studio softcore pornography in Japan. Facing bankruptcy, Japan's major studios took over the ''pink film'' market. In 1971 [[Toei Company|Toei]] entered the sexploitation market with its &quot;Pinky Violence&quot; series,&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-02-18 |last=Domenig|first=Roland|year=2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041118094603/http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|archivedate=2004-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest major film studio, started its ''Roman Porno'' line of ''pink films''.

Kazuko Shirakawa, [[Junko Miyashita]], and [[Naomi Tani]] were the leading Nikkatsu queens of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s were a period of transition in adult entertainment in Japan. With the widespread private ownership of VCRs, theatrical pornographic films had a new competitor for adult audiences in the form of the Adult Video (AV). By 1982 the AVs had already attained an approximately equal share of the adult entertainment market with theatrical erotic films.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; Early AV performers were often struggling actresses who could not find work in the theatrical Roman Porno films and girls from the [[soapland]]s.&lt;ref&gt;AV producer Shoichi Yoshimura, quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-04-20|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|publisher= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate =2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, prominent AV actresses like [[Hitomi Kobayashi]] and [[Kaoru Kuroki]] were becoming multi-media stars, and creating a mainstream image for AVs and pornographic actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosemary|last=Iwamura|url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/7.2/Iwamura.html|title=Letter from Japan: From Girls Who Dress Up Like Boys To Trussed-up Porn Stars - Some of the Contemporary Heroines on the Japanese Screen|accessdate=2007-04-20|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/continuum2.html Continuum: The Australian Journal of Media &amp; Culture; vol. 7 no 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though traditionally not partial to large breasts, in the mid-1980s busty models suddenly become popular in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the &quot;Big Bust Boom&quot; (巨乳ブーム - &quot;Kyonyu Buumu&quot;) was set &quot;on fire&quot; with the AV debut of [[Kimiko Matsuzaka]],&lt;ref&gt; Adachi, Noriyuki. (1992). ''&quot;Adult&quot; People'' (アダルトな人びと - ''Adaruto na Hitobito'') Kodansha. ISBN 4-06-205546-5. p.50&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a &quot;Big Bust&quot; genre in Japanese adult entertainment.

=== Indonesia ===
Pornographic material is prohibited by law from the KUHP, the law controlling pornography concerns over the potential danger of criminal offence by pornography as well as preventing under age citizens exposed to pornography. [[Indecent exposure|Suggestive]] materials in Indonesian media are rare. Current laws prohibits the selling and buying of pornographic materials.
There were a proposed ''Rakyat Undang-Undang anti-pornografi'' (The social law of anti-pornography), but this is controversial since it focus on the woman's body as the object, and it can affect the local culture including some traditional art. What was concerned in that RUU such as child abuse is already recognized in KUHP (Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Pidana)

It can be concluded that pornography in Indonesia is prohibited in terms of creating, distribution, selling, and rental of explicit materials. On October 30, the [[People's Representative Council]] passed a different bill on pornography which is aim to prevent pornography on widespread Indonesian media though this is not directly stated. A controversial material from the bill was a definition of pornography.{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

=== Malaysia ===
In [[Malaysia]], it is illegal to sell or possess&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4194674.stm|title=Malaysia targets mobile phone sex|date=2005-08-29|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; pornography. 

In 2004 and 2005, Malaysia was shocked with a few exposures of budding wannabe pornographers - couples having sex for the camera. While a few show the performers willingly doing it for the camera, others seem to have been captured secretly ([[voyeurism]]).

=== Philippines ===
Any kind of pornography is illegal in the Philippines. This is due to the influence of very [[conservative]] [[political]] parties, such as the [[MTRCB]], and [[Christianity|Christian]] groups and [[Church body|churches]], such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Pornography: Society at Risk

|accessdate=2008-01-01
|last=

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the current law does not specifically outlaw webcam sex sites, which are often based in the Philippines. Plus enforcement is lax, and pornography is available often through black markets and the Internet.

One such example was in July 2008 when a congressman, then Manila Representative Bienvenido Abante, and 11 Baptist pastors of the Baptist organization Bible Mode, sued the publishers of the magazines FHM (For Him Magazine), Maxim, Playboy Philippines, Playhouse, and the tabloids ''Sagad'', ''Hataw'', ''Baliktaran'', and ''Toro'', for 'pornographic content'&lt;ref name=&quot;Abante&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The complaint said that they showed &quot;obscene and erotic pictures/poses that show, depict or describe nude or semi-nude bodies, sexual acts, sexual intercourse [and] private parts, with no educational, artistic value, intended to draw lust and arouse prurient interest&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abante&quot; /&gt;.

=== Singapore ===
Pornography is illegal in Singapore.

=== Brunei ===
Due to the high number of expatriates in this country, pornography from various regions such as the Americas, Africa and Europe are easily available in retail shops known as 'kedai runcit'. However, it is illegal to sell to minors, and it is illegal to produce pornography unless for personal use.

=== Taiwan ===
The sale or display of pornographic material to children under 18 years of age is illegal in [[Taiwan]]. The display of genitals on the cover of magazines is prohibited unless obscured.

=== Thailand ===
Pornography laws in [[Thailand]] prohibit all types of pornography. Production, distribution and possession with an intention to show to the public are criminalized. However, possession for personal use is not illegal. The law enforcement is relatively lax. Other forms of pornography such as [[yaoi]] and [[hentai]] are illegal but common over the [[internet]].

=== Vietnam ===
Illegal. Enforcement is strict. According to the legislatures, pornography harms Vietnamese standard values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catwinternational.org/factbook/Vietnam.php | title=Vietnam - Coalition Against Trafficking of Women | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Asia ==
=== India ===
{{Main article|Pornography in India}}
Pornography in [[India]] is illegal and attracts several penal provisions. However, enforcement is extremely lax and pornographic materials are easily available. The law also states that only the distribution of pornography is illegal, while its creation and accessing is not. Pornographic films in India are referred to as [[Blue Films]] and are available virtually anywhere; especially in areas where pirated material is already being sold.

Section 67 of the Information Technology Act deals with &quot;publishing obscene information in electronic form&quot;. This law has been interpreted to criminalize posting of pornographic content online. However, accessing of &quot;obscene&quot; content within one's privacy is not illegal. The IT Act was amended by the Parliament on 2008, and Section 67B was inserted which criminalizes browsing, downloading, creation, publishing child porn. Therefore while it is legal to watch adult porn, it has been made illegal to watch child porn. Child anime porn has not been explicitly criminalized. [http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/4134097.cms]

=== Bangladesh ===
Pornography is illegal in Bangladesh, however there has been an increase in the numbers of pornographic movies known as 'blue movies'. In [[March 2002]], authorities planned a drive against the pornography business. There are severe punishments given to those caught selling pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1889181.stm Bangladesh plans crackdown on porn] BBC News (Saturday, 23 March, 2002, 08:09 GMT).&lt;/ref&gt; Concern over the rise of pornography has hinted at actions by the government. The then Home Secretary [[Altaf Hossain Choudhury]] said, &quot;We have never really had this problem in the country before, but now it appears that one or two people or agencies are selling pornography all over Bangladesh.&quot; Pornography is particularly popular in the capital [[Dhaka]], where many pornographic movies are available in [[shopping plaza]]s. Reports from the press have also suggested that people have used [[digital camera]]s to film sex scenes and sell copies in the [[black market]], which many have been convicted of. The issue concerns most of the population of Bangladesh, which remains moderately a [[conservative]] Muslim country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1892248.stm Bangladesh concern over porn spread] BBC News (Monday, 25 March, 2002, 12:43 GMT). By Alastair Lawson.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
Pornography is illegal. However, it is easily accessible in most parts of the country, particularly in privately owned video shops and through the internet. Pornographic movies are commonly referred to as ''Blue Print'' movies.

=== Sri Lanka ===
The laws against pornography in Sri Lanka are vague. Under the Explicit Literature Ordinance, sale or possession of pornographic material can be classified as illegal. However, due to this being a very old law, the punishments are very lenient.

However, child pornography is considered to be illegal under the National Child Protection act and the punishments are very severe. This act covers the rights of children, but not pornography per se. Therefore, the same act cannot be used as an anti-pornograhic law.

There is a plethora of pornographic material available throughout the country, in paper and electronic formats. Usually, these are sold undercover. There are also a number of locally produced amateur videos, which are available freely on the Internet. Due to the severity of punishments for child pornograhy (ie. involving persons under the age of 18), it is uncommon to see material of that nature in Sri Lanka.

== Australasia ==
=== Australia ===
{{Main|Censorship in Australia}}
Technically it is illegal to sell or rent X-rated material in all states of Australia, but it is not illegal to possess X-rated material, and the sale or rental of X-rated material is legal in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]. As the [[Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia|Australian constitution]] prohibits states from regulating interstate commerce, it is legal to purchase pornography from stores in either territory and bring it interstate. This law means the majority of Australian mail order operations for adult material operate from the ACT.

Ratings for the X18+ category were tightened in 2000 to ban material featuring some fetishes or which appeared to include minors. In 2007 the Howard Government made the possession of X18+ pornography illegal in some Aboriginal communities.

=== New Zealand ===
Illegal for sale under 18 years of age, however rarely enforced. Generally liberal, although the most extreme forms of pornography ([[pedophilia]], [[rape]], [[bestiality]], etc.) are classified as objectionable material by the law.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
The possession, import, export, and sale of pornography is illegal. Control is strict.

== Africa ==
=== Botswana ===
The possession of &quot;Indecent and obscene material such as pornographic books, magazines, films, videos, DVDs and software&quot; is prohibited in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswanatourism.co.bw/getting_in/entry_requirements.html Botswana Tourism Board], &quot;Entry Requirements&quot;. botswanatourism.co.bw. Accessed on December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Pornography rated [[X18]] is legal if sold to persons over the age of 18 in registered stores. It is illegal to host a pornographic web site in South Africa because of the difficulty of age-verification and the requirement that pornography only be distributed from designated, licensed physical premises. Child pornography is completely illegal (rated [[XX]]) in any form, including the written word. It is illegal to visually represent bestiality (also rated [[XX]]), but not illegal in text descriptions. Violent pornography is illegal in any form. It is legal to produce pornography that would be legal to consume.

Distribution of pornography is regulated by the [[Films and Publications Act of 1996]] [http://www.info.gov.za/acts/1996/a65-96.pdf] which is enforced by the [[Films and Publications Board]] [http://www.fpb.gov.za/home_page.asp].

==Middle East==
===Azerbijan===
In [[Azerbaijan]] in accordance with article 3 of the Media Act of [[December 7]], [[1999]], the &quot;pornographic materials&quot; are defined as works of art, photographic reproductions of paintings, information and other materials the main content of which is the crude and undignified depiction of the anatomical and physiological aspects of sexual relations.
Pornography in Azerbaijan is easily and cheaply obtainable in [[Baku]], although not in most other places. Pornographic images, either printed or recorded may cause problems when crossing the border. Taking the soft-core materials should have no problems, but Azeri borders guards can require a few extra euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.travel-images.com/az-sex.html | title=Sex in Azerbaijan - Ñåêñ â Àçåðáàéäæàíå - Azerb.com | accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile the legal activity to combat [[child pornography]] is governed by 1998 Rights of the Child Act, 1999 Media Act, the Plan of Measures to Solve the Problem of Homeless and Street Children and the National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/children/rapporteur/Russia%20Gov%20Translation.doc | title=Information concerning the questionnaire of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography | format=DOC | accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], pornographic films began to be produced in the 1990s, but most of the films were shot in the 2000s. Israeli pornography may be considered nascent but has gone a long way since its beginnings. Today, the biggest pornography company is ''SexStyle'' that produces films for the Israeli public. In 2003, the first pornographic film featuring [[Arab]] performers, produced by this company, caused a public uproar among [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.israelforum.com/board/showthread.php?t=2215 | title=Israeli Arab Porn Video Inflames Community Passions - Israel Forum | accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli law defines a few prohibitions on [[child pornography]] and on [[pay per view]] television (PPV was legal but now only softcore porn allowed on TV). Otherwise, pornography can be sold, bought and produced in Israel.

===Iran===
In [[Iran]], pornography is illegal. However, due to widespread internet access (in particular, downloading programs) and the existence of a large-scale black market in [[Western world|Western]] films, pornography is not completely unknown in the country and is called &quot;super film&quot;.  In a law that in mid-2007 was passed by parliament but still required approval of the [[Guardian Council]], producers of pornographic films face execution if found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3276645 | title=Iran Parliament Backs Porn Death Penalty| accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], pornographic films started to pop up with the introduction of Arabic pop music and the beginning of secularism. It is illegal to produce or advertise any sort of pornographic film, though the law is lax to the extent that many Arabs from other parts of the Middle East come to purchase porn films and magazines (which are often packed in opaque bags) starring Lebanese and other Arab porn stars. Many pornographic movies in Lebanon endorse images of Arab pop stars, along with promises that they will be featured in the movie. It is illegal to produce or broadcast pornography on national television stations.

===Other Arab nations===
In other [[Arab nations]] such as [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], or the [[United Arab Emirates]], it is illegal to distribute or produce pornographic materials, although in Egypt web sites featuring pornography are not blocked.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pornography in Europe''' has been dominated by a few pan-European producers and distributors, the most notable of which is the [[Private Media Group]] that had successfully claimed the throne of [[Color Climax Corporation]] in early 1990s. Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from [[Portugal]] (e.g. ''Naturalvideo'') to [[Serbia]] (e.g. ''Hexor''), with varying potentials of competition with international producers. 

[[Hungary]] is noted for having liberal pornography laws. [[Czech Republic]], with its specialised companies such as the [[erotic spanking|spanking]] producers ''Lupus Pictures'', [[gay pornography]] label ''[[Bel Ami (adult film company)|Bel Ami]]'' and for having become the regular European destination of the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Japan]]ese producers, is a likely rival. [[Romania]] is also considered a &quot;rising star&quot; of European pornography in mid-2000s, mainly thanks to pornographic ''auteur'' [[Raul Cristian]] of ''Floyd-Agency''.

The once popular style of Euro-chic pornography represented by directors [[Lasse Braun]], [[Joe d'Amato]], and [[Jean Rollin|Michel Gentil]] has lost ground and the [[Pierre Woodman]] style of video porn now attracts a larger audience. A few directors like [[Luca Damiano]], [[Mario Salieri]], and [[Alain Payet]] continue with the &quot;older&quot; cinematographic and dramatic styles that often distinguish ''European'' pornography from those of other cultures.

==France==
In early 1970s, [[France|French]] viewers had become familiar with stag films shot in the [[Netherlands]], featuring French actresses such as [[Claudine Beccarie]] and [[Sylvia Bourdon]]. The first genuine French pornographic film ''Les Baiseuses'' by Guy Gibert was released in 1975. The first French porn film that met international success was ''[[Le Sexe qui parle]]'' by [[Claude Mulot]], which was released the same year (followed by a sequel two years later). This film was so successful that it was exported to the US, with the name ''Pussy Talk''. 

In 1976, a law that put considerable sanctions on pornographic films in distribution and taxation, known popularly as ''Code X'' was imposed, creating a situation that forced pornography develop itself on its own right. Since then, pornography has been a growing economy in France, now existing in various forms from magazines to satellite TV broadcasting. 

Producers of video pornography can be divided into two segments: companies like ''Vidéo Marc Dorcel'', which produces &quot;[[porn chic|chic]]&quot; adult feature films for the international market and companies that produce low-budget videos almost exclusively for domestic market (''Œil du Cochon'', ''Euro Choc'', ''Ragtime'', etc.). The latter type also tends to focus on popular fetishes such as [[rape pornography|rape]], [[incest pornography|incest]], and [[fisting]] (as indicated in the classic series ''Viol, inceste &amp; fist-fucking'' (Rape, Incest, and Fist-Fucking) by Fabien Lafait).

==Germany==
Early years of [[Germany|German]] pornography began with the softcore film ''Graf Porno und seine Mädchen'' (Count Porno and his girls) in 1968. The movie's success (more than 3 million admissions) lead to a whole series of films that was and is referred to in German media as the ''Sex-Welle'' (sex wave). The most well known film of this period is ''[[Schulmädchen-Report]]: Was Eltern nicht für möglich halten'' (The School-Girl Report, what the parents don't believe possible) by [[Ernst Hofbauer]] in 1970. The sex scenes had become bolder with time and by 1975, when the legal ban of pornography was lifted, the era of German [[hardcore pornography]] began. 

Director [[Hans Billian]] was the protagonist of the period and the films were usually in line with the so-called &quot;[[Bavarian porn|Bavarian porn sex comedies]]&quot;, often depicting male performers as comic characters, like Sepp Gneißl in ''Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber'' (1977). This era was also characterised by several [[Josephine Mutzenbacher]] films.

Today's German pornography is generally very similar to the American &quot;[[glamour (charm)|glamour]]&quot; pornography though often tailored primarily for the German market. In contrast several German labels focus on a more &quot;home-made&quot; amateur flair, often focusing on intense hardcore themes such as [[gang bang]]s, [[bukkake]] and [[urine fetishism]]; most notably 'German Goo Girls' and other series by [[John Thompson Productions]].

Due to popular belief outside of Germany, [[coprophilia|fecal pornography]] known as &quot;[[Scheisse]] porn&quot; (using the German slang word for faeces) or, more commonly, as &quot;[[Kaviar]]&quot; (a generic term) supposedly is particularly popular in Germany, with companies like ''SG-Video'' and performers like Austrian [[Veronica Moser]] or English [[Ben Chambers]] specializing in the concept. Although German companies have their fair world market share in producing for this niche market, the major percentage is sold into export. [http://www.beh-ev.de/]

==Italy==
Although [[Italy]] had accumulated a lot of [[softcore]] pornography in 1970s, hardcore pornography was not a usual trend until 1980s. The first pornographic film in Italy was ''[[Il Telefono rosso]]'' (The red telephone) in 1983 by [[Riccardo Schicchi]] with [[Ilona Staller]] (aka &quot;Cicciolina&quot;). The film caused much controversy and it was restrained from legal release until 1986 with an alternate revision of Italian censorship laws.

With this atmosphere of liberty, Italian producers rushed to meet on-screen curiosities of viewers to even gain the title of presenting &quot;[[Zoophilia#Pornography|bestiality]]&quot; in mainstream pornographic films; a trend shared by [[Rocco Siffredi]] in his 2003 film ''Hazardous Duty'' (in the European release by ''Night Trips''). Italian pornography producers depended on French actresses or expatriates like [[Marina Hedman]] (with the notable exception [[Moana Pozzi]] with her ''Valentina, ragazza in calore'' by Raniero di Giovanbattista in 1981) till the arrival of Hungarian Gabriella Kovács (aka &quot;Angelica Bella&quot;) in 1991 but following this, Italy faced an influx of female pornography performers from ex-[[East Europe]]. 

In today's Italian pornography, the strong emphasis is placed on aggressive [[anal sex]] often with implied coercion. Many Italian films have no vaginal intercourse at all, being strictly about anal sex. Another popular theme is [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|age disparity]] between sexual partners, giving way to the ''Incesto'' films by directors like [[Andy Casanova]] and [[Eros Cristobaldi]]. Director Andy Casanova's popular series ''Stupri Italiani'' also introduces rape as a popular theme.

==Russia and Ukraine==
{{main|Russian pornography and erotica}}
[[Russia]] (along with [[Ukraine]]) is a unique source for international porn producers, in that it has plenty of [[Whites|Caucasian]] models with relatively low wages, a situation that allows producing low-budget pornography without possible &quot;ethnic&quot; expressions.

Most Russian porn is produced in [[Moscow]] and in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] where the largest [[adult film]] producer, ''SP-Company'', is based. The types of Russian adult films may range from [[gonzo pornography]] to adaptations of Russian classics (''[[Eugene Onegin]]'' (by Tatiana Taneyeva (2003)), ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (by [[Armen Oganezov]] (2002)), etc.) and these productions basically aim the domestic market. Much of the pornography is produced for the international internet market.

Recently, there have been a proliferation of internet sites featuring Russian porn. The Russian nationality of the models is emphasised by some of these porn sites, but in other cases the model may be presented as &quot;European&quot;, &quot;American&quot; or even &quot;[[Latino|Latina]]&quot;. Also, certain internet sites are now featuring Russian porn in the ''[[reality porn]]'' genre. Sites that offer predominantly Russian content routinely block access from the Russian segment of the Internet to maintain the privacy of the models. Some studios also produce or used to produce both adult pornography and [[child pornography]] (see [[2004 Ukrainian child pornography raids]]).

==United Kingdom==

In Britain, where pornography is more restricted than it is in many other English-speaking or Western Europe countries, sexual media is easily smeared for an audience that is seldom given an opportunity to see what really is sold under the name of &quot;pornography&quot;.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.fiawol.demon.co.uk/FAC/harm.htm]&lt;/sup&gt; However the current British legislative framework including the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] (in England and Wales), the [[Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982]] and the [[Video Recordings Act 1984]] leads to a confusing situation in which there is a theoretical ban on the publication and distribution (but not possession) of pornographic material in any form, which is in practice unenforcable due to the vagueness of the legal test of material that &quot;depraves and corrupts&quot;.  In practice, hardcore material on video and DVD was until recently banned by the requirement under the Video Recordings Act to be certifed by the [[BBFC]], while mainstream hardcore material in other forms such as magazines and websites is essentially unrestricted.  European, American and British hardcore pornographic magazines are now openly sold in many British newsagents, for instance.  Due to libralisation in BBFC policy, mainstream hardcore DVDs now receive [[R18 certificate|R18]] certificates, legalising them but restricting their sale to licensed sex shops such as those in [[Soho]].

British-made pornography tends to focus on a rough-and-ready semi-amateur look rather than the more stylized glamourous look of Continental European pornography.

Producers such as [[Ben Dover]] concentrate on producing &quot;girl-next-door&quot; or &quot;candid&quot; material. Some British pornography concentrates on [[sexual fetishism]], particularly [[erotic spanking]] and [[Rubber and PVC fetishism|rubber fetishism]] which has been popular in Britain since the 1950s.

Despite the existence of a national porn industry and widespread social acceptance of porn consumption, the UK is still the only Member State of the European Union that prohibits private imports of adult pornography by consumers coming from other Member States of the European Union. In the 2004-2005 fiscal year, the agents of Her Majesty Revenue &amp; Customs seized 96783 items of pornographic media carried by people travelling into the UK&quot;.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/about/hmrc-report2005.pdf]&lt;/sup&gt;.

The UK porn industry is estimated to be now worth about 1 billion pounds, compared with 20 billion pounds worldwide.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/lifestyle/2006-05/30/content_604004.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Japanese pornography''' has some unique features which separate it from [[pornography]] in other countries, especially [[Western world|Western]] pornography. It is quite common and frequently translated and exported to Western cultures because of its large spectrum of themes and media. Including drawn and virtual pornography, Japan is currently the largest pornographic producer in the world, producing more pornography than that of the United States.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
The concept of &quot;pornography&quot; may have emerged in the [[Edo period]] when every form of popular culture flourished. All forms of pornography flourished, with the sole exception of [[figure]]s and [[statue]]s. This does not mean there were no earlier works of [[erotica]]; these early works were by highly literate [[nobility|nobles]] and were often considered works of art. [[Japanese mythology]], later formulated into the system known as [[Shinto]], makes multiple references to [[human sexuality|sexuality]], but almost always in a positive manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chrisxtjapan.blogspot.com/2007/10/synopsis-shinto-sex-shunga-and.html Synopsis: Shinto, Sex, Shunga and Ecocrisis] by dhushara's &quot;Japan Blog&quot; chrisxtjapan.[[blogspot.com]], October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Edo period, pornography flourished due to the unique characteristic of the city of [[Edo]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In this period, men (who were the only consumers of pornographic material at that time) made up well over 60% of the population.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} These men came from all over Japan to work, and remained there for years before returning to their hometown to have a wife arranged for them, having learned valuable skills like reading, writing, and crafts{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. With a disproportionate amount of the population being male, state-controlled prostitution districts like [[Yoshiwara]] and pornography were needed{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

There were many pornographic materials. [[Shunga]] or pornographic wood-block pictures were printed with all imaginable situations. These often took the form of a book with sentences to describe verbal utterances of the partners, as well as to offer brief descriptions of a scene. Near the end of the Edo period when foreigners became widely known and seen, even interracial sex acts with foreign males were drawn and sold, not to mention [[Zoophilia|acts with animals]], demons (both [[incubus (demon)|male]] and [[succubus|female]]), and deities. The actual uses of shunga in the period are still debated, but probably resembled modern uses of pornographic materials, including [[masturbation]] and shared viewing with a lover. According to some accounts, called into doubt by recent scholarship, shunga were even packed by the parents of a wife for use in her marriage. Shunga could also be borrowed from a rental book shop. In 1808, there were 656 such shops in Edo, 300 shops in [[Osaka]]. This means that there was about one shop for every 1500 people in Edo. Non-pornographic materials were also available from these shops. These included [[Woodcut|woodblock]] pictures of celebrities like [[kabuki]] actors and [[geisha]], clothed in kimono.

After the [[Meiji restoration]] in the second half of the 19th century, the publication of pornographic materials declined under government pressure, specifically the fear that such an openly sexual culture would be seen as a sign of backwardness by European countries. Yet even as Shunga production slowed, shunga were being exported and peddled as &quot;erotic arts&quot; to foreign markets. Pornographic novels were still produced underground, though the language barrier prevented them from becoming widely known abroad. Pornographic arts (now including photography) were still produced by popular demand, but these came to be viewed as low arts.

===20th century===
In the late [[Taishō period]] and early [[Shōwa period]], an artistic movement called ''[[Ero guro|Eroguronansensu]]'', lit. erotic-grotesque-nonsense, occurred influenced by decadence works of Europe. These words were used because they had an air of a new and modern feeling. Until the 1950s, pornography were still very limited in production. Open sexual expressions were permitted in novels and manga but a strict control was applied on photographs and films. During [[World War II]], pornographic materials were banned altogether.

Influenced by magazines like [[Playboy]], pornographic magazines were printed soon after [[World War II]]. These magazines quickly branched to cover all genres and featured pornographic novels as well as pictures. Playboy itself, however, did not succeed in [[Japan]]. Its articles were about the [[American lifestyle]]; women were mostly non-Asian, interviews were with people largely unknown in Japan, and fashion and sport were  American. Instead, it spawned a fetish and a genre known as ''[[Yomono]]'', lit. Western things. Playboy revamped its articles and style in the early 2000s in Japan by having Japanese writers write exclusively about Japan and dropping most of the original content.

In the early 1960s, several movie studios began producing &quot;[[Pink film|pink movies]]&quot; to be exclusively viewed in an adult-only movie theater. With censorship laws prohibiting genitals from being seen but otherwise free to express anything, these movies quickly diversified to fill all genres, including rape and bondage.
Throughout the 1960s, the &quot;pink films&quot; were mainly produced by low-budget, independent filmmakers such as [[Koji Wakamatsu]]. In 1971, the major studio [[Nikkatsu]] entered the pink film genre with its higher production values through its ''Roman porno'' (lit. romantic porno) series. From the 1960s to the late 1980s, ambiguous censorship laws resulted in hundreds of cases regarding erotica and pornography. At midnight, television stations mostly aired soft-core pornographic movies until their ratings dropped due to the pornographic movies.

Homosexually-oriented magazines began to appear, starting with [[Barazoku]] in 1971, which continued publishing until 2004. Homosexual magazines tend to be tailored to particular segments of the population, such as [[Badi (magazine)|Badi]] which features younger adult males, [[Samson (magazine)|Samson]], devoted to chubby men, and [[G-men (magazine)|G-men]], featuring muscular men. The websites of these magazines also feature videos produced featuring these respective body types.

===1980s===
The proliferation of pornographic videos in the 1980s commonly called AV, short for adult video, eventually crashed the market for pornographic movie theaters. Rental video stores offered pornography at a price far below that of movie theaters. Because most Japanese families now had at least two television sets and VCRs, more videos were sold. It is rumored, but not supported, that [[VHS]] became popular over [[Betamax]] format because large numbers of AV were released in VHS format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2007/gb20070122_279828.htm?campaign_id=rss_topStories|first=Ian|last=Rowley|title=Next-Gen DVD's Porn Struggle|date=2007-01-22|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=''[[Businessweek]]''|quote=One oft-recalled explanation for the failure of Sony's (SNE) Betamax videocassette format in the 1980s was the Japanese company's ambivalence towards producers of pornographic videos. By contrast, proponents of VHS, Betamax's rival, welcomed adult content with open arms and, the legend goes, caused Betamax's demise.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few AVs were sold in [[laserdisc]] format, but VCDs and later DVDs were used to distribute AV.

In 1983, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Family Computer]] was released and a few pornographic games quickly followed. However, Nintendo wanted these machines to be family oriented and pornographic games were locked out of the market.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} [[Computer game]]s with no limitation on content except for censorship laws became a popular way to distribute pornographic games. Early VCDs and DVDs were viewed on [[personal computer]]s. Because so few Japanese people saw any reason to play games on these platforms, as opposed to video game consoles, playing computer games was sometimes viewed as being synonymous with playing [[Bishōjo game]]s.

In the late 1980s, the [[Dōjinshi]] market expanded. It is estimated that about half of this market consists of pornography. Copyright problems plague the market, yet the dōjinshi market was a common place for one to start before making a debut in a professional magazine. [[Yaoi]] began in the dōjinshi market. From the mid 1990s, the dōjinshi market also began making and selling pornographic games.

In 1980s, magazines oriented towards a mature male audience began to offer more explicit content. This was not immediately a major social issue because magazines oriented towards a mature female audience already existed and their content was in some ways more explicit.

===1990s===
According to John Carr, a United Kingdom government adviser on Internet safety policy for children, two-thirds of pedophilic images on the Internet in the late 1990s may have originated in Japan. He further commented &quot;''We think that child pornography, in any form, promotes values and sends the message that it is OK to sexually abuse children. It helps pedophiles to justify their ideas or behavior and it desensitizes society as a whole.''&quot; Since the law against child pornography in 1999, the proportion is now believed to be less than 2%. ECPAT believes that many child pornography producers have simply turned to producing anime or films featuring adults dressed as children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Laws and movements==
Japanese pornography has diversified to fill a vast number of categories and needs, with some themes being so obscure that the appeals and differences are too subtle for anyone but the most devoted to recognize. These diversities occurred because of three major reasons: to entertain by developing new methods of expression, to fill niche markets, and to work around [[Censorship in Japan|censorship laws]]. Neither religious conservatism nor feminism had been a powerful factor in pornography in Japan.

===Censorship laws===
The religious and social taboo against [[nudity]] has historically been weaker in Japan than in the West: &quot;[[pillow book]]s&quot; detailing sexual acts were widely sold in the [[Edo era]], and women and men routinely worked in the nude and bathed in public up to, and even after, the [[Meiji Restoration]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. While in [[western culture|Western society]] nudity has typically been a [[taboo]], that idea entered Japan only after [[Meiji-era]] and how deep that idea is rooted is argued. Extreme [[public nudity]], such as showing the genital area, would nevertheless be prosecuted in Japan (except in public baths). Japan has only had one or two nudist beaches, and these were private.

In Japan, under Article 175 of the [[Criminal Code of Japan]] people who sell or distribute obscene materials can be punished by fines or imprisonment. Article 175 was included in the original document in 1907 and remains relatively unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/hourei/data/PC.pdf The Penal Code], translated into English by the [[Cabinet Secretariat]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Finding a workable definition for obscene has sparked much controversy over the last century. It is not uncommon for pictorial magazines to depict nude women with their genitalia airbrushed over in black, and video pornography routinely depicts explicit sex scenes with the participants' genitalia obscured by [[Pixelization|mosaics]]. Until the 1990s, the entire pubic region, including hair, was deemed obscene and unpublishable. The publication of ''[[Waterfruit]]'' and ''Santa Fe'' by [[Kishin Shinoyama]] marked the first widely distributed publications to feature [[pubic hair]]. Many video production companies belong to ethical associations which provide guidance on what is acceptable and what is not. NEVA and CERO are examples of two such organizations. In 2007, the police have started to prosecute webmasters who allow uncensored pictures on their sites. Recent controversies have frowned upon both pubic hair and even genitalia itself being displayed in works of art and in educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also illegal to bring pornographic material into Japan, and customs agents are known for checking videotapes in international mail and hand baggage. Extreme cases, like multiple offenders or attempts at commercial importation, could be punished by fines but most merely have their [[contraband]] confiscated. Applications of this law did not change in recent years, but more offenders are caught in recent years as checks became tighter to prevent the [[drug trade]] and terrorism.

There is also a thriving genre of underground pornography in Japan (called ''[[Wiktionary:urabon|urabon]]'') that ignores these censorship laws; it has become especially prevalent on the Internet, as there are no mechanisms in place to prevent its transmission from Japanese nationals to the outside world. On [[November 1]], [[1999]], Japan introduced laws to outlaw [[child pornography]] in an attempt to converge with the U.S. and other western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and pornography===
Religions are not a factor in regulations of pornography nor defining of immorality in Japan. It is instead defined by a consensus, due to the fact that the separation of religion and state was complete before the proliferation of pornography. In the [[Edo period]], [[Tokugawa shogunate]] limited religions' activities to organizing ceremonies such as funerals and marriages, because during the [[Sengoku period]], religions like [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]] served as ideological backbones to rebellions. The shogunate recognized the danger of religious fanaticism and stopped participation of religious leaders in policy making.

===Child pornography===
{{Main|Child pornography laws in Japan}}
Distribution, production, importing, exporting, and possessing for distribution of [[child pornography]] is banned with criminal punishment in Japan since 1999.

Possessing without distribution has been disputed point since the establishment of the law.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Setsuko Tsuboi, &quot;Child Rights: Act on Punishment of Activities Relating to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (子どもの人権: 子ども買春・子どもポルノ禁止法)&quot;, ''Hougaku Seminar (法学セミナー)'' (ISSN:0439-3295) Vol. 44, No. 9, pp. 54-57, Sep. 1999. (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Diet, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and the [[New Komeito Party]] proposed to 
prohibit the possessing without distribution, the [[Democratic Party of Japan]] presented a counterproposal to prohibit the　taking over from anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpj.or.jp/news/?num=15504 Democrat's proposal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] was dissolved on July 21, 2009, the amendment of the law against [[child prostitution]] and child pornography on the table were withdrawn.

=== Prostitution ===

The demand for prostitutes has increased on a year to year basis. The sex industry now accounts for 1% of the GNP, and equals the Japanese defense budget. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;CATW - Asia Pacific, Trafficking in Women and Prostitution in the Asia Pacific&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese sex industry is a multibillion-dollar business that caters to every preference and is easily accessible. &lt;ref&gt;Pornography Easy To Find in Japan&quot;, Joseph Coleman, Associated Press, October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; One &quot;sex zone&quot; in Tokyo, only .34&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;., has 3,500 sex facilities, including strip theaters, peep shows, &quot;soaplands&quot;, &quot;lover's banks&quot;, porno shops, telephone clubs, karaoke bars, clubs etc. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; One third of all reported cases of prostitution are teenagers. &lt;ref&gt;1996 National Police Agency survey, &quot;Tokyo cracks down on teenage prostitution ‘clubs’,&quot; Reuters, 13 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Enjo kosai or &quot;supportive relationship&quot; is the euphemism used in Japan for the prostitution of teenage girls. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Japanese law would ban sex under 17,&quot; Agence France Presse, 24 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Trafficking in Persons Report, released yearly has ranked Japan as Tier II on par with Cambodia, Ethiopia among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm Trafficking in Persons Report 2008], by [[U.S. Department of State]] on June 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This rank has remained relatively stable for the past decade.



==Culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

Japanese pornographic culture is more widely accepted as part of mainstream media in comparison to the west. Thus in many cases, scenes acceptable to Japanese audiences are unacceptable in other countries. [[Ribaldry]] is quite common even in child oriented materials and expressions that in most other cultures would not be acceptable for general audiences are shown without a warning. For example, in an early chapter of [[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]], to find an invisible opponent, [[Muten-Rôshi]] is shown [[Bulma]]'s bared breast, eliciting a fountaining nose bleed that drenches the invisible man.

Japanese erotica has many of the same themes as its western counterpart such as [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] intercourse, [[group sex]], and [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. Similarly to [[western erotica]] the Japanese version may also portray various [[sexual fetishes]] such as [[foot fetishism]], or a focus on a certain type of clothing such as uniforms or costumes as [[anime]], [[manga]] or [[video game]] characters. ''(See [[cosplay]] for more details, note that the term cosplay itself does not relate to pornography)''

[[Image:Dream of the fishermans wife hokusai.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'' by [[Hokusai]].]]
Many genres of Japanese erotica evolved because of censorship laws. [[Tentacle rape]], an animated portrayal of rape fantasies involving a human female and a [[science fiction]]-like creature originated in the Edo era. ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', a wood print of a woman in a sexual act with a giant octopus is one example of tentacle rape. It emerged as an alternative to depicting the penis in the 1980s, and it became famous for its depiction in the anime, ''[[Legend of the Overfiend]]''.

===Sub-genres of Japanese porn===
The pornographic culture of Japan is enormous. Encompassing dozens of different genres only found in Japan, it has become an important part of life for most Japanese males{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. To satisfy the demand for more arousal, many genres have popped up over the decades.

赤ちゃんプレイ（Aka-Chan Pure）: (&quot;baby play&quot;): This genre involves going back to the &quot;baby days&quot; where they had no responsibility and could depend on their mothers to take care of everything.

バーチャルデート Baacharu Deito: (&quot;virtual date&quot;): Shot from the point of view of the boyfriend, the porn actress takes him on a &quot;date&quot; which ends in a sexual scene.

Broken Dolls: This is a subgenre based on the popular medical fetish and involves young girls in hospital beds, covered in casts, splints, gauze, and fake bruises. It usually involves rape and forced bondage.

ブルセラ[[Panty fetishism|Burusera]] (&quot;bloomers&quot;): Fans of this genre collect panties, urine, socks and uniforms of actual schoolgirls.

痴漢プレイ[[Frotteurism|Chikan Pure]] (&quot;groper&quot;): It involves usually schoolgirls sitting in a stage constructed to look like a train car and act submissive while being groped by anonymous male.

援助交際 [[Enjo kōsai]] (&quot;compensated date&quot;): Although available on video, this genre mainly applies to the market for girls 13–18 years of age. Girls are told they are going on a date, which, due to Japan's age of consent of 13, is not illegal.

強姦プレイ[[Goukan Pure]] (&quot;rape play&quot;): This genre involves simulated rape.

ロリコン[[Lolicon]] (short for &quot;lolita complex&quot;): This genre involves prepubescent and adolescent girls.

人形 Ningyou (&quot;dolls&quot;): Some fans of animation like to play with dolls of their favorite characters.

===Dōjin and parodies===
{{Main|Dōjinshi}}

Dōjinshi, &quot;fan works&quot;, are widely known as often being pornographic imitations of popular anime, games and manga. They are technically a violation of copyright law and can be prosecuted if the owner of copyrighted material chooses to have them prosecuted. But in many cases, owners officially ignore their existence. This attitude is at odds with the concept of copyright. However, this practice is common as it is a good way to measure how large the core of consumers are. For instance, the number of dōjinshi published is representative of the number of consumers who would spend liberally on the title, and increase and decrease shows rise of interest and its decline.

===Anime===
{{Main|H anime}}

Animated erotica (known in the West as [[hentai]], but in Japan as &quot;adult anime&quot;) is a popular genre in Japan and generally maintains the same style of animation seen in other popular forms of Japanese animation ([[anime]]). Many of these anime are originally a game, [[manga]], or a novel.

===Games===
{{Main|Bishōjo game|H game}}

Adult oriented games are a popular genre for computer games in Japan, comprising some 85% of all software titles published annually.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The genre is somewhat unknown outside Japan because of several problems, cultural and translational, but their artworks are well known on internet websites often illegally copied and shown as &quot;adult anime pictures&quot;. Known as &quot;bishōjo games&quot; or &quot;pretty girl games&quot; (alternately spelled &quot;bishojo&quot; or &quot;bishoujo&quot;) in Japanese, the games are known under several names used by English fans, including PC dating-sim game, [[hentai game]]/[[H game]], and so on. Companies such as Peach Princess, [[JAST USA]] and G-Collections are translating [[dating sim]]s and [[visual novel]]s into English for the fledgling market outside of Japan. Adult video games in Japan are rated &quot;Z&quot; by the [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]], from now on.

===Internet===
[[Fanfiction]]s, commonly found in websites, are not limited to fictitious characters and often use real live people as well, though these works would make little sense to those who do not see Japanese TV programs. Dōjinshi writers typically use the Internet to market their products by offering previews of new works, a secret address where buyers can find additional works, and a sample of their games. They also recruit new writers and artists online. Several exclusively adult oriented search engines exist to let someone find a site they are looking for, without having to search through commercial websites that list all keywords. Many works of dōjinshi are featured in websites that collect the art and let people look for free.

Many websites feature seasonal greeting pictures, often pornographic, from linked sites and friends who frequent their sites. A typical Christmas greeting picture on such sites features a santa-girl in various stages of undressing. The twelve zodiac animals of [[Chinese astrology]] offer challenging and entertaining examples of [[Catgirl]].

===Japanese Adult Video proliferation===

With the growing connectivity of the World Wide Web, JAV has received exponential growth in exposure to the West.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} With the growth of porn tube sites, many tube sites focus on the JAV niche, the most prominent in North America{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} being sites like [[Youporn]], and fast growing new JAV-only tube sites such as [http://www.youjav.com/ YouJav.com]

===Magazines===
Magazines are, along with videos, popular media for pornographic materials. Unless a magazine contains pornographic manga or pictures, there is a no age requirement for its purchase. Many non-pornographic magazines have some [[glamour photography]] and as long as women are in something more than a swimsuit, it is considered a non-pornographic photograph. Several non-pornographic magazines have some nude photographs of women as a part of their articles but as long as they have an artistic quality and do not show men, it is not considered pornographic. Furthermore, a female and male doll may be partially clothed or even nude as long as it is a work of art and is not in an act of sex.

Confessional writings by both genders are a popular topic in men's and pornographic magazines. Quite often, these writings are fictional stories written by professional authors. Other popular topics in men's and pornographic magazines are erotic manga and novels, reviews of pornographic videos, and reports of sex services.

Women's magazines also have most of the writings of men's and pornographic magazines. Except for a few glamour photographs of men (who are usually clothed), they lack graphic pornographic contents. Few, if any, of magazines targeted for women are considered pornographic or have an age requirement as they lack any graphic content {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.

===Manga===
{{See also|Josei|Seinen|H Manga}}

[[Manga]] with a pornographic content target both male and female audiences and both male and female [[mangaka]] (manga authors) write pornographic works.

The dividing line for manga on what is pornography and what is not, can be summed up by a simple rule: that which requires age verification to purchase is pornography, and that which does not require an age verification are not pornography. Pornographic manga are often sealed, so that one cannot take a peek and most of such manga are sold in an adult oriented store. The general attitude to pornography is closer to that of literature. If a sex scene has relevance in the progression of the storyline and not simply an attempt to offer sex for sex's sake, it is not considered pornography. However, this would be unacceptable in most cultures and it breaks many of censorship codes and laws outside of Japan.

A manga that does not target mature audiences may also have a page or two of what looks similar to glamour photography. These nude or semi-nude scenes with objects or hands covering breast and genital area are called a &quot;service scene&quot;. These scenes are often a part of comical sequence.

===Video===
{{Unbalanced|section|date=August 2009}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SDDM100.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Futari 02'', a [[Lesbianism in erotica|rezu]] (lesbian)-themed Japanese adult video.|{{ifdc|1=Image:SDDM100.jpg|log=2007 December 27}}]] --&gt;
Pornographic video (called &quot;adult video&quot; or &quot;AV&quot; in Japan or sometimes &quot;Japanese adult video&quot; or &quot;JAV&quot; outside of it) covers wide themes and its only limit is censorship laws.

Many videos have a title that may suggest that they use minors or the actual recording of a crime, but no titles that are circulated with the approval of ''Eirin'', a self-censor organization of productions, break any laws. A common ploy is to have a part of a title replaced with a character, or to use a phonetically similar neologism. For example, a video about &quot;19 years old girls Sex Party!&quot; may be sold with a title like &quot;1X years old Girls Sex Party!&quot;. The word {{nihongo|'''Joshikosei'''|女子高生|}}, lit. &quot;High school girl,&quot; cannot be used as it would suggest a girl of 17 years or younger, who cannot act in a pornographic video. The homonymic neologism {{nihongo|'''Joshikosei'''|女子校生|}}, which can mean a &quot;girl student,&quot; is used in many titles to promote the product without breaking censorship laws. This fact may be seen in popular places of Japan such as [[Akihabara]] or Den Den Town at Tokyo and Osaka respectively.

Japanese AV also caters to many more fetishes than might be imagined (or thought legal) by non-Japanese. Schoolgirl or uniform themed AV dovetails with the aforementioned 'non-consensual' genre&amp;mdash;{{nihongo|rape|レイプ|reipu|}}&amp;mdash;are common. SM, rope bondage, bestiality, virgins, internal male climax or {{nihongo|cream-pies|中出し|nakadashi|}}, {{nihongo|lesbians|レズ|rezu|}}, along with more eccentric fetishes (soap, office ladies, game shows) are all covered.

==Impacts on other cultures==
Copyright infringement has created a problem in places where legal copies are purchased such as [[Asia]], U.S. and Europe. To avoid spending money on hiring translators for conversations that often precedes an act of sex, it has become normal to cut and piece together a video filled with various scenes of sex and nothing else. Further, to avoid the need for explaining a scene, especially on infringing copies in countries where violence in pornography is heavily censored, videos with simulated rape scenes became a niche of Japanese pornography.

'''Pornography in the United States''' is a legal term at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] level, except the generic terms &quot;[[hardcore pornography]]&quot;{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} and &quot;[[Child pornography#United States|child pornography]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law''. 1996, ISBN 0-87779-604-1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} do not exist after the 1973 ''[[Miller v.

Hinkelman, Myron Manley, James L. Nolan, Karla C. Shippey, Wendy Bidwell, Alexandra Woznick. ''Importers Manual USA'', 2005. ISBN 1-885073-93-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawful definition of pornography in the U.S. evolved through decades, from 1960s. In this period, recognizing ambiguities, it was chosen to use the term &quot;[[Human sexuality|sexually]] explicit content&quot; as one of the pornography's [[euphemism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Youth, Pornography and the Internet'', National Academy Press, 2002. ISBN 0-309-08274-9&lt;/ref&gt; but later it was determined that a distinction between pornographic and sexually explicit content is completely artificial.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. House.

The definition &quot;graphic sexually explicit subordination of women, whether in pictures or in words&quot;, worded by [[feminist]]s in [[Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance]] has been twice struck down, in 1983 and 1985 (in the [[Minneapolis City Council]] by the mayor and in [[Indianapolis]] by a federal appeals court in ''American Booksellers Association v.

==Overview==
American pornography refers mainly to the [[internet]], [[Pornographic film|adult movies]], publications (with mainstream journals ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Penthouse magazine|Penthouse]]'', and ''[[Hustler]]''), and [[pay-per-view]] broadcasting. The so-called portable porn market is in its initial stage in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Musgrove, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/14/AR2005111401456_pf.html &quot;Mini-Porn Could Be Mega-Business&quot;], ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[November 15]], [[2005]], p. D01. Accessed [[29 June]] [[2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cellphone companies are reluctant to become partners with the adult entertainment for fear of being stigmatized by community standards.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Lever, [http://iafrica.com/loveandsex/features/558204.htm &quot;Porn industry goes high tech&quot;], iafrica.com, [[15 February]] [[2006]] (via the [[Internet Archive]]).

In 1975 the total retail value of all the [[hardcore pornography]] in the U.S. was estimated at $5-10 million.&lt;ref name=Amis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4153718,00.html |title=A rough trade |accessdate=2009-04-10 |author=[[Martin Amis]] |date=2001-03-17 |publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1979 Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that &quot;in [[Los Angeles]] alone, the porno business does $100 million a year in gross retain volume&quot; while &quot;the average porno magazine sells for between $6 and $10 each&quot;.

''USA Today'' claimed in 2003 that websites such as [http://www.danni.com/ Danni's Hard Drive] and [http://www.cybererotica.com/ Cybererotica.com] generated $2 billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Swartz, [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2004-03-09-onlineporn_x.htm &quot;Online porn often leads high-tech way&quot;], USATODAY.com, [[9 March]] [[2004]].

''The Online Journalism Review'', published by the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication|Annenberg School of Communication]] at the [[University of Southern California]], weighed in with an analysis that favored ''Forbes''' number. The financial extent of adult films, distributed in hotels, is hard to estimate—hotels keep statistics to themselves or do not keep them at all.&lt;ref&gt;Matt Bradley, [http://www.usatoday.com/travel/hotels/2006-09-06-hotel-pornography_x.htm &quot;Groups protest porn on hotel TVs&quot;],  USATODAY.com, [[6 September]] [[2006]]. Accessed [[29 June]] [[2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[CBS News]] investigation in November 2003 claimed that 50% of guests at the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]], [[Marriott International|Marriott]], [[Hyatt]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], and [[Holiday Inn]] hotel chains purchased adult movies, contributing to 70% of in-room profits. The income of [[Mobile porn|cellphone porn]] is low, when compared with other countries. The absence of [[V-chip]]-style parental controls largely has kept American consumers from using cellphones to access explicit content.

The term &quot;pornography&quot; (from [[Greek language|Greek]] πόρνη (pórnē), a prostitute) first comes from an 1857 British [[medical dictionary]], which defined it as &quot;a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kendrick. ''The Secret Museum: Pornography in Modern Culture''. 1997. ISBN 0-520-20729-7&lt;/ref&gt; therefore pornography by itself was not a widely used term in nineteenth-century America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.Law.Columbia.edu/law_culture/LHworkshop2005/final%20selectee%20papers/ObsPros&amp;consequences-long.doc www2.Law.Columbia.edu Pornography’s Past: Sexual Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt; and the term did not appear in any version of ''[[American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' in its early editions. The dictionary introduced the entry in 1864, defining it primarily as a &quot;treatment of, or a treatise on, the subject of prostitutes or prostitution&quot;. Early charges used the term &quot;obscenity&quot; as well as after ''Miller v. California'', though the term &quot;pornography&quot; remained as a reference entry:

The upcoming censorship of pornographic materials in the United States became based on the First and partially [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]]&lt;ref&gt;Paul Abramson, Steven D. Pinkerton, Mark Huppin. ''Sexual Rights in America: The Ninth Amendment and the Pursuit of Happiness''. 2003, ISBN 0-8147-0692-4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments to [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. It also includes the so-called [[harm principle]], as well as in [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr500/fall1999/www_presentations/c_hogg/argue.htm General arguments for and against the censorship of pornography]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]] interpretation of the First Amendment as applied to pornography has never been sustained by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[William A. Donohue]]. ''The Politics of the American Civil Liberties Union'', 1985. ISBN 0-87855-983-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Investigation of Literature Allegedly Containing Objectionable Material'', issued by the [[U.S. Congress]] Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials in 1953, it was noted that &quot;perhaps the greatest impediments to the prompt and effective enforcement of existing laws intended to control pornographic materials are the difficulties of establishing a precise interpretation of the word&quot;. During the Warren Court (1953-1969), the first notable court to face the cases of such kind, justices Potter Stewart, [[Byron White]], and [[Arthur Goldberg]] shared the opinion that only hardcore pornography was not protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Michal R. Belknap. ''The Supreme Court Under Earl Warren, 1953-1969''. 2005, ISBN 1-57003-563-6&lt;/ref&gt; This position was contested notably by [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]] [[James Lee Rankin]] (in office 1956-1961),&lt;ref&gt;Linda Williams. ''Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the &quot;Frenzy of the Visible&quot;''. 1999, ISBN 0-520-21943-0&lt;/ref&gt; but in Jacobellis v. Ohio Stewart concluded that criminal obscenity laws are constitutionally limited under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to hardcore pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegis.com/law/SCt/Decisions/1964/378US184.html Aegis.com Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184 (1964)]&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring in the 1957 ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote: &quot;[E]ven assuming that pornography cannot be deemed ever to cause in an immediate sense, criminal...conduct, other interests within the proper cognizance of the State may be protected by the prohibition placed on such materials.&quot;

The 1967 [[Public Law]] 90-100 found the traffic in pornography to be &quot;a matter of national concern&quot;, as well as in obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Report. 1970&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the Court considered pornography to have two major dimensions. The first can be defined as dealing with sexual representations that are offensive to public morality or taste, which concerned the Court notably in the 1966 ''[[Ginzburg v. United States]]'' case. The second centers on the effect of pornography on specific individuals or classes, which is the focus of most public discussions and prior Court pornography decisions. This dimension was mentioned only twice in the array of decisions made in 1966. A frustration was expressed notably by Justice [[Hugo Black]] in the 1966 ''[[Mishkin v. New York]]'': &quot;I wish once more to express my objections to saddling this Court with the irksome and inevitably unpopular and unwholesome task of finally deciding by a case-by-case, sight-by-sight personal judgment of the members of this Court what pornography (whatever that means) is too hard core for people to see or read.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/speech/adultent/topic.aspx?topic=pornography FirstAmendmentCenter.org Adult Entertainment in Speech]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1974 ''[[Hamling v. United States]]'' decision the Supreme Court said that just because pornographic materials are for sale and purchased around the country, &quot;does not make them witnesses of virtue... Mere availability of similar materials by itself means nothing more than that other persons are engaged in similar activities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralityinmedia.org/index.htm?obscenityEnforcement/cliches2.htm MoralityinMedia.org Myths about Pornography and Obscenity Law]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' defined that pornography consists of &quot;written, graphic, or other forms of communication intended to excite lascivious feelings&quot;. Since determining what is pornography and what is &quot;soft core&quot; and &quot;hard core&quot; are subjective questions to judges, juries, and law enforcement officials, it is difficult to define, since the law cases cannot print examples for the courts to follow.&lt;ref&gt;''The People's Law Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rehnquist Court]] further enhanced the power of community controls on pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Singh. ''Contemporary American Politics and Society: Issues and Controversies''. 2003, ISBN 0-7619-4096-0&lt;/ref&gt; Current Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] told at the confirmation hearing on his nomination: &quot;...it's my understanding under the Supreme Court's doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;United States.

In May 2005 [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] established an Obscenity Prosecution Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1125318960389 Law.com ''U.S. Attorney's Porn Fight Gets Bad Reviews'' by Julie Kay, ''Daily Business Review'' August 30, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The task force, according to a [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] news release on May 5, was &quot;dedicated to the investigation and prosecution of the distributors of hard-core pornography that meets the test for obscenity, as defined by the United States Supreme Court.&quot; Under President [[George W. Bush|Bush]]'s and Gonzales' rationales the [[FBI]] Adult Obscenity Squad&lt;ref&gt;[http://jacksonville.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel06/sexualexploitation091206.htm Jacksonville.FBI.gov Press Release - Department of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; was recruited in August 2005 to gather evidence against &quot;manufacturers and purveyors&quot; of adult pornography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html?nav=hcmodule WashingtonPost.com ''Recruits Sought for Porn Squad'' by Barton Gellman]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child pornography===
{{main|Child pornography}}
The 1970 [[Lockhart Commission]] recommended eliminating all criminal penalties for pornography except for pornographic depictions of minors, or sale of pornography to minors.&lt;ref name=&quot;breakthrough&quot;&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/obscenity.htm Law.umkc.edu The First Amendment and Obscenity and Public Nudity]&lt;/ref&gt; However prior to 1977, only two states had laws which prohibited the use of children in the production or distribution of pornographic materials or performances.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on the Judiciary. Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice. ''Federal Assistance to States to Prevent the Abuse of Children in Child Care Facilities''. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the Department of Justice strongly endorsed legislation which banned the production and dissemination of child pornography.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on the Judiciary. Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice. ''Computer Pornograph [i.e. Pornography] and Child Exploitation Prevention Act''. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have been successfully challenged in the 1982 ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'' case (&quot;Recognizing and classifying child pornography as a category of material outside the protection of the First Amendment is not incompatible with our earlier decisions&quot;). Although the states have a different [[age of consent]], in accordance with the [[Federal Labeling and Record-Keeping Law]] all models featured in pornographic content should be 18 years of age. This kind of material is often labeled as &quot;adult&quot; and the appropriate disclaimers are common. They are based on what &quot;depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;47 U.S.C.A. §223(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-pornography movement===
:''Further information: [[Anti-pornography movement#United States Supreme Court Jurisprudence|United States Supreme Court Jurisprudence on anti-pornography movement]]
{{see also|Fighting words}} 
The so-called &quot;sex wars&quot; of the late seventies&lt;ref&gt;Henry L. Minton. ''Gay and Lesbian Studies''. 1993, ISBN 1-56024-307-4&lt;/ref&gt; challenged the traditional understanding of the gender role. [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]] became well-known often-cited anti-pornography authors. Many debates have attended their political intervention into the law by way of their advocacy of anti-pornography ordinances in several [[Mid West|midwestern]] cities. Other notable American anti-pornography activists to belong to this camp are [[Robin Morgan]] and [[Susan Griffin]]. Ordinary [[libertarian]]s, who separate sex and violence, take MacKinnon and Dworkin to task for their refusal to leave sexual expression alone.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Dumm. ''United States''. 1994, ISBN 0-8014-3002-X&lt;/ref&gt; This was done particularly by Gillian Rodgerson and Elizabeth Wilson in ''Pornography and Feminism: The Case Against Censorship'': &quot;Yet this theoretical cocktail of biologism and [[Behaviorism|behaviourism]] is lethal. To see men as naturally programmed for violence is to endorse the most conservative views on human nature, and to see it as unchanging and unchangeable&quot;. Rodgerson and Wilson argue that pornography plays a relatively minor role in the wider regime of [[sexist]] practices pervading women's lives.&lt;ref&gt;Per ''Approaches to Popular Film'', ed. by Joanne Hollows and Mark Jancovich. 1995, ISBN 0-7190-4393-X&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Indianapolis definition of pornography by Dworkin and MacKinnon paralleled their Minneapolis ordinance. The first was rejected by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] for several reasons. The ordinance did not use any of the accepted terms that the Supreme Court had developed over time for determining when material is obscene, including &quot;prurient interest&quot;, &quot;offensiveness&quot;, or &quot;local community standarts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moral&quot;&gt;''Moral Controversies In American Politics: Cases in Social Regulatory Policy'', ed. by Raymond Tatlovich and Byron W. Daynes. 2004, ISBN 0-7656-1420-0&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern was the way the women were depicted in the work. If women were referred to in the approved fashion stressing equality, the activity involved would be regardless of how sexually explicit it was.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moral&quot;/&gt; The Court also indicated that if women were referred to in a disapproving way depicting them as subversive or as enjoying humiliation, the activity would be unlawful regardless of the &quot;literary, artistic or political qualities of the work taken as a whole&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moral&quot;/&gt; Judge [[Frank Easterbrook]] said: &quot;We accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and injury at home, battery and [[rape]] on the streets...but...this simply demonstrates the power of pornography as speech.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pornography-censorship/notes.html#2 Plato.Stanford.edu ''Pornography and Censorship'' by Caroline West first published Wed 5 May, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conceptions of Democracy in American Constitutional Argument: The Case of Pornography Regulation'' by [[Frank Michelman]], issued by Tennessee Law Review (vol. 56, no. 291, 1989) partially consented that &quot;pornography is political expression in that it promulgates a certain view of women's natures and thus of women's appropriate relations and treatment in society&quot;, but also concluded that the Indianopolis ordinance was precisely designed to suppress that particular view by censoring pornography. Minneapolis ordinance was struck down on the grounds that it was ambiguous and vague, however despite of its failure the proposal influenced other communities across America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moral&quot;/&gt;

Another matter, which frequently circulates in American anti-pornography movement is a close bond of pornography with rape. According to ''Porn Up, Rape Down'' by [[Northwestern University]] Law Professor Anthony D’amato, &quot;the incidence of rape in the United States has declined 85 per cent in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults&quot;. Recognizing that the Nixon and Reagan Commissions tried to show that exposure to pornographic materials produced social violence, D'amato concludes that &quot;the reverse may be true: that pornography has reduced social violence&quot;. D'amato suggests there are two predominant reasons why an increase in the availability of pornography has led to a reduction in rape. First, using pornographic material provides an easy avenue for the sexually desirous to &quot;get it out of their system&quot;. Second, D'amato points to the so-called &quot;Victorian effect&quot;. It dates back to the British [[Victorian era]] where people covered up their bodies with an immense amount of clothing, generating a greater mystery as to what they looked like naked. D'amato suggests that the free availability of pornography since the 1970s, and the recent bombardment of internet pornography, has de-mystified sex, thus satisfying the sexually curious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=4845 ''Pornography has its benefits'' by James McConvill; posted Friday, 29 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
The internet maintains a significant part of American adult entertainment, also because the 1997 ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'' case specified that the term &quot;[[wiktionary:indecent|indecent]]&quot; also has no specific legal meaning in the context of the internet. More recent federal efforts, such as the [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] expressly addressed the internet.&lt;ref&gt;William A. (EDT) Finkelstein, James R. (EDT) Sims, ''Intellectual Property Handbook''. 2005, ISBN 1-59031-585-5&lt;/ref&gt; On [[May 1]], [[2000]] [[American Express]] announced it no longer covers transactions from adult sites.&lt;ref&gt;ZDNet News ''AMEX just says 'no' to porn sites'' by Margaret Kane&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,36608,00.html Wired News: Amex Nixes X-Rated Exchanges]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Committee to Study Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content, subscription sites with adult content exceed 100,000 in the United States, with each site having multiple web pages underneath it. On average, a paid subscription generates $20 to $40 per month in revenue, however an in-depth analysis is complicated. If a visitor site connects to a pay site and signs up for content, it receives a conversion fee from the larger site. A successful large operation like Cybererotica is an umbrella company serving many markets with pay sites. Around this core and its affiliates is a system of ad-supported service sites, such as California-based [http://www.ynot.com/ YNOT.com], a [[Web portal|portal]] for porn [[webmaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.02/sex_pr.html Edward Cone.

Among several marginal sites are [http://www.sexbizlaw.com SexBizLaw.com], a legal resource for the adult-entertainment industry, Seattle internet traffic monitor [http://www.sextracker.com/ SexTracker.com] and [http://pornvalleynews.com PornValleyNews.com]. &lt;!-- On May 6, 2006 Utherverse Inc. company launched RedLightCenter.com, an online erotic universe supporting thousands of players, similar to the ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and the ''[[Second Life]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/news/?id=12705 GameDaily BIZ RedLightCenter.com Integrates Female Intimacy]&lt;/ref&gt; Can't check out whether Utherverse Inc. is American :P --&gt; There is also a vast amount of [[e-zine]]s, including all mainstream. ''Playboy'' was quick to jump on the Web and made its content differed from the print version. ''[[Fleshbot]]'' online magazine features sex-related digital technologies and their distribution.

===Controversies===
As any other pornographic branch in the world, American web segment faces different trials and debates, notably on the [[.xxx]] domain. In 2000 the owners and operators of [http://www.playgirltv.com/ Playgirl.com] and scores of other adult sites have been charged by the [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] with illegally billing thousands of consumers for services that were advertised as free, and for billing other consumers who never visited the web sites at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-934 Outlaw.com US authorities take action against porn sites for illegal billing]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nevada]]n Voice Media Incorporated, which runs several adult sites such as Cybererotica, Clubpix.com, XXXpassword.com, ff5.com, and Boobtropolis.com, later was also charged by the Commission. Namely Cybererotica by itself suffers from unauthorized, non-paying surfers who use the stolen passwords. This kind of attack could easily use an entire month’s worth of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] in a day, with the site operator paying hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of additional bandwidth fees, all for traffic that returns no money at all.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Perdue. ''EroticaBiz: How Sex Shaped the Internet''. 2002. ISBN 0-595-25612-0&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 ''[[Paragon Electric Co., Inc. v. Buy This Domain]]'' case ruled that linking domain names to pornographic sites is not per se conclusive of bad-faith registration and use, although it does raise that presumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/d2001-1439.html WIPO Case No. D2001-1439]&lt;/ref&gt; A web address remained a common occurrence in this sense.

==Movies and pay-per-view==
{{see also|History of erotic depictions|Nudity in American television|Cable Indecency Decision}}
Much of the pornography produced in the United States is in the form of movies and the branch acutely competes with the internet. The market is very diverse and ranges from the mainstream [[heterosexual]] content to the rarefied [[S/M]], [[BDSM]], [[interracial]] sex, ethnic, etc. through enduringly popular [[gay porn]].

Early American [[stag film]]s included ''Wonders of the Unseen World'' (1927), ''An Author's True Story'' (1933), ''Goodyear'' (1950s), ''[[Smart Alec (1951 film)|Smart Alec]]'' (1951), and ''Playmates'' (1956-58). The breakthrough films such as 1972 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and 1978 ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'', that launched the so-called [[porno chic]], put the adult movies production onto the commercialization. &lt;!--In 1978 American porn industry gained a 4 billion USD income&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.genderpolicy.ru/old/bin/Gloss-new.doc Глоссарий для регионального проекта по гендерному образованию]&lt;/ref&gt; Dubious--&gt; In this period America's most notorious pornographer was [[Reuben Sturman]]. According to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], throughout the 1970s Sturman controlled most of the pornography circulating in the country.

The country now houses over 40 adult movies studios featuring heterosexual scenes,&lt;ref&gt;[[List of pornographic film studios|List_of_pornographic_film_studios]]&lt;/ref&gt; more than any other country. The branch, according to founder and president of ''Adult Video News'' Paul Fishbein involves the manufacturers of adult products, distributors, suppliers, retail store owners, wholesalers, distributors, cable TV buyers, and foreign buyers. The production is concentrated in [[San Fernando Valley]] (mainly in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth]], [[Reseda, Los Angeles, California|Reseda]] and Van Nuys) and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where more than 200 adult entertainment companies gather to network and show off their latest wares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/21/60minutes/main585049.shtml CBSNews.com Porn In The U.S.A.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The annual output is about 3,000 movies&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.rusawm.com/articles.php?id=186 Логово американской порноиндустрии]&lt;/ref&gt; Dubious --&gt; The world's largest adult movies studio, [[Vivid Entertainment]] generates an estimated $100 million a year in revenue, distributing 60 films annually&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/business/2005/03/07/cz_bp_0307vivid.html Forbes.com The Porn King]&lt;/ref&gt; and selling them in video stores, hotel rooms, on cable systems, and on the internet. Vivid's two largest regional competitors are [[Wicked Pictures]] and [[Digital Playground]]. [[Colorado]]-based [[New Frontier Media]], a leading distributor of adult movies (at [[NASDAQ]] since November 2000) is one of the two adult video companies traded publicly, the another one being Spanish [[Private Media Group]].

The industry's decision to embrace [[VHS]] in the early 1980s, for example, helped to do away with [[Sony Betamax]], despite the latter format's superior quality. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to half-billion by 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2003/06/01/343376/index.htm Money.CNN.com Prime-Time Porn Borrowing tactics from the old Hollywood studios...]&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering at the hands of video [[warez]] tended not be publicly stressed by country's film industry.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drahos, John Braithwaite.

In the recent years, according to Fishbein, there are well over 800 million rentals of adult videotapes and [[Digital Versatile Disc|DVD]]s in video stores across the country. Digital Playground said it is choosing the Blu-ray Disc for all of its &quot;interactive&quot; films because of its greater capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/05/02/pornhd/index.php?lsrc=mwrss Macworld.com Porn industry may be decider in Blu-ray, HD-DVD battle]&lt;/ref&gt;

The female demographic is considered to be the biggest catalyst for pornographic cultural crossover.&lt;ref&gt;Andi Zeisler, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/25/CMGF77DFT31.DTL &quot;Porn Plague: Has porn's proliferation desensitized us to its power?&quot;], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[July 25]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adella O'Neal, a Digital Playground publicist, in 2000 roughly 9% of the company's consumers were women while four years later that figure has bloomed to 53%.

American adult pay-per-view television is presently unregulated since it is not technically &quot;broadcasting&quot; as defined in the [[Federal Communications Act]]. [[List of United States cable and satellite television networks|Cable and satellite television networks]] host about six main adult-related channels. Most of them (particularly [[Playboy TV]], [[Penthouse TV]], and [[Hustler TV (US)|Hustler TV]] (there is also a &quot;Hustler Video&quot;, a line of raunchy films created by [[Larry Flynt]])) are maintained by three mainstream porn magazines. In 1999 Playboy Enterprises sold to Vivid Entertainment a small channel which was renamed to Hot Network. Since that Vivid launched two more channels—the Hot Zone and Vivid TV. The viewers paid close to $400 million a year to tune in to Vivid's hardcore content and the company soon overtook Playboy as operator of the world's largest adult-TV network. However, after passing the 2000 ''[[United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group]]'' case Playboy bought all three networks from Vivid in 2001 and folded them into &quot;Playboy's Spice&quot; brand. Operators then shunned &quot;Playboy's Spice Platinum&quot;, a new group of channels with graphic hardcore fare.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Figler, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DIZ/is_21_13/ai_75120095 &quot;Playboy's New Porn Channels Are Too Spicy For Some&quot;], ''Cable World'', [[May 21]], [[2001]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] of major corporations are the largest pornography sellers, like [[News Corporation]]'s [[Direct TV]]. [[Comcast]], the nation's largest cable company, once pulled in $50 million from adult programming. Revenues of companies such as Playboy and Hustler were small by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/commercial-alert/2000/000042.html ''New York Times'', October 23, 2000 ''Wall Street Meets Pornography'' by Timothy Egan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
American adult magazines which have the widest distribution do not violate the Miller test and can be legally distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/pornplag.html ''The Pornography Plague'' by Kerby Anderson]&lt;/ref&gt; Adult magazines have been largely put into mainstream by the pioneer ''Playboy''. However during the so-called [[Pubic Wars]] in 1960s and 1970s ''Penthouse'' established itself as a more explicit magazine. [[Screw magazine]] moved the bar towards Hard-Core when it first came out in 1968 and with [[Hustler]] appearing in 1974 the move to Hard Care was complete.  By the mid-'90s magazines like ''Playboy'' had become noncompetitive and even hardcore publications like ''Penthouse'' and ''Hustler'' struggled. According to [[Laura Kipnis]], a cultural theorist and critic, &quot;the ''Hustler'' body is an unromanticized body—no [[vaseline]]d lens or soft focus: this is neither the [[airbrush]]ed top-heavy fantasy body of ''Playboy'', nor the ersatz opulence, the lingeried and sensitive crotch shots of ''Penthouse'', transforming [[female genitals]] into ''objets d'art''. It's a body, not a surface or a suntan: insistently material, defiantly vulgar, corporeal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Per ''Photography: A Critical Introduction'', ed. by Liz Wells. Routledge, 2000, p. 230. ISBN 0-415-19058-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Many adult magazines in the United States are now highlighted by special features and are usually sold wrapped to avoid their look-see by the under-age persons. A primarily [[softcore]] ''[[Barely Legal (magazine)|Barely Legal]]'' focuses on models between 18 and 23 years. ''[[Hustler's Leg World]]'' is focused on the female legs and feet. ''[[Perfect 10]]'' publishes the images of women, untouched by [[plastic surgery]] or airbrushing.

Pornographic bookstores have been subject to [[zoning laws]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Easton. ''The Problem of Pornography: Regulation and the Right to Free Speech''. 1994, ISBN 0-415-09182-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games and Japanese influence==
{{see|Pornography in Japan}}
[[Microsoft]] has long declined to license development software to game makers whose titles include sexual content. [[Wal-Mart]], America's largest distributor of video games, maintains the policy of selling no [[Adult video games|games with an AO rating]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/11/technology/e3_nekkidgames/index.htm &quot;Video games get raunchy&quot;], Money.CNN.com &lt;/ref&gt; However in recent years the pornographic content in video games has been promoted particularly by Playboy. ''[[Playboy: The Mansion]]'' became the first game built around the &quot;Playboy&quot; license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/25/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ &quot;Video game gals take it off for Playboy&quot;], Money.CNN.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

A downloadable [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]—&quot;[[Hot Coffee]]&quot;—developed by Dutch [[Hacker (computing)|hacker]] Patrick Wildenborg in 2004, according to Jason Della Rocca, executive director of the [[International Game Developers Association]], accelerated the need to discuss the challenges faced in creating games with pornographic content. The two-day [[San Francisco]] gathering was held in June 2006 to delve into the design, development, and technology of sex in video games, also in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexinvideogames.com/ Sexinvideogames.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' was pulled from shelves by [[Rockstar Games]] after it became public knowledge that, with the use of a [[Gameshark]], a scene can be unlocked portraying the protagonist having sex with another character. In the scene both characters have their clothes on. The game was later sold without the unlockable scene.

[[Playstation 2]] video game ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'' features an event in the first part of the game where protagonist [[Kratos]] can have sex with two topless [[prostitution|prostitutes]], who reside in a bedroom on his boat. Although no sexual acts are depicted (they occur off-screen and are indicated by sound effects), the women are shown topless. The player interacts by performing button and joystick commands that appear on screen which results in an experience reward for the player.

The adult sections of American [[comic book]] stores carry a large number of translations of Japanese hardcore comics, as well as an increasing number of home imitations.&lt;ref&gt;''Porn Studies'', ed. by Linda Williams, 2004. ISBN 0-8223-3312-0.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the [[anime]] porn movies, which started the American adult video market, was ''[[Urotsukidoji]]''. The adult anime market exists primarily through direct sales: mail-order to customers, and wholesale to specialty shops which cater to anime and to comic-book fans.&lt;ref&gt; Fred Patten, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.4/3.4pages/3.4patten.html &quot;The Anime 'Porn' Market&quot;], Animation World Magazine, Issue 3.4, July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The legal framework in both countries regarding the regulation of obscene and pornographic material is overall rather similar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.umn.edu/~kane0034/censor/pornusjcomparisson-engtext.htm ''US and Japan pornography regulation traditions and trends''] by Dan Kanemitsu (2002/3 revision)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pornography in the Soviet Union==
Pornography in the Soviet Union was largely suppressed until the final years of the USSR. According to ''The Pornography and Erotica Debate: USSR'', sex in general was viewed as &quot;a wasteful consumer of energies better devoted to the building of Communism.&quot; In the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalinist]] period, the importation of pornography to the USSR was a capital offence. [[Genrikh Yagoda]], the third head of the [[NKVD]], was accused during his trial (besides espionage and high treason) of storing a great number of pornographic films and pictures. Such accusations were also faced by [[Yezhov]], who followed Yagoda. More recently, possession could get up to 3 years in prison, or a 300 ruble fine. The 1988 Soviet film ''[[Malenkaya Vera]]'' was the first to feature a sex scene. The resolution on [[Glasnost]] stated, &quot;Glasnost must not be used...[to] disseminate pornography&quot; but by September 1989, calendars of topless women for the year 1990 were being sold in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Linda Harriet (1992). ''Women and Society in Russia and the Soviet Union''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with staff at Hot Specialty, veterans of the trade associate the beginnings of Russian [[erotica]] with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]’s [http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Perestroika.html Perestroika] &lt;ref&gt;Goldman 1992, The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;, when the country for the first time in fifty years opened its borders. Deep-seated social changes along with a sexual emancipation were among the most prominent effects of the fall of the [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC19/Excerpts.htm iron curtain] &lt;ref&gt;Burtin 1998, Context Library&lt;/ref&gt;. Softened social norms and numerous commercial incentives provided to small businesses by the government made the country ready and yearning for erotic entertainment. [http://www.hotspecialty.com/enter/index.php?main_page=hist_russian_erotica ''Hot Specialty''] interviewers report groups of Soviet youth spending their spare hours in underground establishments overflowing with narcotics and promiscuous sexual activity. These places were responsible for the production of first Soviet amateur pornography. With rapid dissemination of consumer electronics such as VCR and portable camcorder, a simple porn studio and an adult movie theater could be set up in small converted apartments. Porn and erotica had a ready market that was quickly filled by Soviet entrepreneurs. Remarkably so, pornography was more than entertainment. The historical importance of this phenomenon was in its enduring social factors. Proliferation of adult materials helped eliminate notorious Soviet sexual restraint, mitigated the strictness of norms of morality and helped people find ways to self-regulating the standards of their sexual behavior and interaction. Many of the consequences of the “sexual revolution” in the Soviet Union laid out the plan for a grander change in violent 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Dynarski 2008, Hot Specialty&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Contemporary erotica and pornography in Russia ==
Russian adult movies are often seen as a more sensual, emotional and a natural, lifelike alternative to the mainstream American pornographic movies that are spread across all continents. Russian erotica has its own unique taste, scent, and culture, perhaps just like any high-quality erotica, whether you find it in Italy, France, or Russia. Russian adult cinema is deep-settled within the framework of century-old traditions and cultural heritage. It is for this reason that the uniqueness of Russian erotica is a genuine concept that can be witnessed and experienced. These movies are unique because originality is their essential nature, not because a marketer in a penthouse office claims them to be such.

Variety is another trait worth mentioning. In the short span of its life, Russian erotica has ascended to the point of including a diverse range of unique adult categories all with different features and themes. Some erotic attributes of this vivid imagery are inordinately beautiful and gracious, while others may seem wildly barbaric and presumptuous. That’s because there is no single standard of beauty as such, and studios try to respect and cater to all tastes and audiences.

== Terminology ==
Russian directors and the entire community of adult-movie fans, critiques, and others intrigued by the rare sexual appeal of the Russian movies, often shun away from using the term pornography. Rightfully so, they prefer a more accurate term of Erotica, which stands for a more creative and passionate dramatic performance. It's almost as if you open up a new world of virgin ideas that have never been tainted by the cookie-cutter approach that we see in the steady flow of identical clones that flooded the market in the past decade or so. 

Another reason for the use of the term Erotica as opposed to Pornography has its roots in the etymology of words and their established use in Russian society. The word porn, while spelled the same around the globe, may mean one thing in New York and stand for an entirely different concept in Moscow. There is no legal definition of pornography in Russia, but the social and linguistic look at the word makes it disreputable and notorious. In the United States it is generally accepted that the word pornography refers to scenes that contain images of penetration and vivid sexual activity. In some of the Russian cities and localities, however, parameters such as penetration and sexual activity aren’t even attached to the term pornography. Instead, pornography refers to images of underage sex and bestiality. The differences in the use of words are obviously rather extreme. This is the one kind of word play you wouldn’t want to forget about.  

Erotica in Russia, on the other hand, often refers to sophisticated and refined adult entertainment, with or without close-up shots and vivid exposure of penetration. Instead on commenting on so to speak, technical attributes, the term Erotica rather contracts an approach that describes the nature and spirit of the movie as such. Say, a classy movie emerged in the luxury of early 19th century Russian noble life and depicting sexual merriment in glorious historical palaces, would definitely be classified as high-class erotica, irrespectively of the technical details such as close-ups and penetration. To distinguish the latter, there are terms like softcore erotica and hardcore erotica, which you are most likely fully aware of.

== Genres ==
Out of the great multitude of adult genres in the world, nearly all are represented in one way or another in Russia. Some studios, like Moscow’s ''Strawberry'' lead by ingenious Sergey Loginov, actually experiment with new styles and work in entirely new directions that stagger with their inventive skill and erotic imagination. The main thing to point out about the organization of Russian adult genres is that Russian studios tend to specialize in one or a few narrow categories. Some of the erotic classes present in Russia are amateur and homemade porn that highlights realistic unfeigned experience, mainstream hardcore erotica that converges on historical plots and is embedded in cultural contexts, softcore erotica that emphasizes natural female beauty, and an astonishing group of fetish trends that seek to satisfy a diverse range of peculiar erotic fantasies. 

== Russian porn around the World ==
Until recently, there hasn't been a centralized online portal where enthusiasts could search through Russian adult movie collections. Now and then one could happen to spot a few different movies on the auction sites such as Ebay, and in the back corners of big-city specialty adult stores. Among the problems haunting these retail locations was constant lack of variety and a great percentage of low-quality counterfeits. In December 2007, ''HotSpecialty.com'' opened its doors to customers in the United States and abroad. The store made available movies and information from ten adult Russian studios specializing in over twenty totally different erotic genres. As of the summer 2008, the store reported two hundred plus genuine Russian erotic titles. 

== Legal challenges ==
Pornography in Russia is a topic of baffling complexity. On the one hand, year 1996 was marked by a passing of [http://russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionIX/Chapter25.html section 242]&lt;ref&gt;Russian Criminal Code 1996, Article 242&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Russian Criminal Code'', which became a federal legislation that prohibited sale and production of [http://oblaka.nu/laws/ &quot;illegal&quot; pornographic materials]&lt;ref&gt;Osipov 2003, Oblaka&lt;/ref&gt;. The section provides for a penalty of up to 2 years in prison. Authorities missed a critical definition—the one of actual pornography. While pornography is officially illegal to sell in Russia, the law doesn’t spell out in exact terms the subject of the ban. Russian erotica is sold openly in sex shops and DVD stores. Newspapers publish information about police raids on such places on a monthly basis. Owners would be detained and adult products confiscated, only to be released after a brief investigation that stalls at any attempt to press charges. Supporters of the adult industry have referred to this situation as offensive,{{Fact|date=February 2009}} but impervious to any immediate change. Advocates of a new law clamour for a clear distinction between pornography and erotica.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nihongo|'''Hamedori'''|ハメ撮り}} is a Japanese term describing filming or photography of sexual activity from a first-person point of view. It also refers to a [[genre]] of [[Japanese pornography]] in which a male adult video (AV) actor/director serves as the [[camera operator]] while also performing.

According to the Japanese magazine ''SPA!'', about one-third of Japanese women say they don't mind being filmed while having sex as long as it's with a camera phone, with the women saying that it can increase sexual stimulation. Most of the footage is dumped but some keep them to enjoy as personal sex home movies or to study them to improve their sexual technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellphones.ca/news/post002032/|title=Japanese Women Want Love-Making Captured by Cameraphone|publisher=[http://www.cellphones.ca/ www.cellphones.ca]|accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pornographic genre of hamedori is a type of [[Gonzo pornography|gonzo]] [[videography]] where the viewer witnesses the sex act from the man's perspective to perhaps experience the act vicariously. Much of Japanese porn takes a documentary-style approach and hamedori type videos were produced from the beginnings of Japanese AV in the early 1980s. The term hamedori came into use about 1988-1989 but was only a small niche area until it was popularized at [[V&amp;R Planning]] by director [[Company Matsuo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;midnight&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/company-matsuo-and-the-world-of-japanese-adult-video.shtml|title=Company Matsuo and the World of Japanese Adult Video|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com/ Midnight Eye]|accessdate=2009-08-07|last=Schoenherr|first=Johannes|date=December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matsuo starting working in the genre in 1991 saying that this intimate technique was a natural way for him to shoot in order to show his feelings for the girl and to &quot;get her to open up about herself, to show her true emotions&quot;. Matsuo used amateur actresses in his videos and he usually traveled to their hometowns for the filming. He talks to them extensively on camera so that he and the viewer can come to know them before any sex scenes. A large part of the popularity of these videos is seeing how regular and ordinary the girls are who appear in them. As amateurs in a single segment of a multi-part video, the actresses are typically paid only about 50,000 yen (about $500).&lt;ref name=&quot;midnight&quot;/&gt;

Because the performer is attempting to engage in sex acts while holding the camera, the resulting footage can exhibit a large amount of &quot;camera shake&quot;. Also, this approach inherently limits the repertoire of video techniques that the camera operator can employ.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nihongo|'''Pink film'''|ピンク映画|''Pinku eiga'' or Pink eiga}} is a style of [[Japan]]ese [[softcore|softcore pornographic]] theatrical film. Films of this genre first appeared in the early 1960s, and dominated the Japanese domestic cinema from the mid-1960s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richie|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Richie|title=A Hundred Years of Japanese Film: A Concise History|chapter=After the Wave|year=2001|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=4-7700-2682-X|quote=For a time, almost half of the annual film production figures released in Japan were composed of these hour-long mini-features.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-02-19|last=Domenig|first=Roland|year=2002|quote=Since the mid-1960s, pink eiga have been the biggest Japanese film genre...

In the 1970s, some of Japan's major studios, facing the loss of their theatrical audience, took over the ''pink film''. With their access to higher production-values and talent, some of these films became critical and popular successes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-02-19|last=Domenig|first=Roland|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the appearance of the [[chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] (adult video) took away most of the ''pink film'' audience in the 1980s, films in this genre are still being produced.

==Description of the ''pink film''==

&quot;The eroductions are the limpest of softcore, and though there is much breast and buttock display, though there are simulations of intercourse, none of the working parts are ever shown. Indeed, one pubic hair breaks an unwritten but closely observed code. Though this last problem is solved by shaving the actresses, the larger remains: how to stimulate when the means are missing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;– '''[[Donald Richie]] (1972)'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Richie-156&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Richie|first=Donald|title=A Lateral View: Essays on Culture and Style in Contemporary Japan|origyear=1972|year=1987|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0-962813-74-5|chapter=The Japanese Eroduction|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The ''pink film'', or &quot;eroduction&quot; as it was first called,&lt;ref&gt;Domenig. ''Vital Flesh''. &quot;The term pink eiga was first coined in 1963 by journalist Murai Minoru. But it did not come into general use until the late 1960s. In the early years the films were known as 'eroduction films' (erodakushon eiga) or 'three-million-yen-films' (sanbyakuman eiga).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; is a cinematic genre without exact equivalent in the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;/&gt; Though called pornography, the terms &quot;[[erotica]],&quot; &quot;[[soft porn]]&quot; and &quot;[[sexploitation]]&quot; have been suggested as more appropriate, although none of these precisely matches the ''pink film'' genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-20&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books: Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-889288-52-7|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the nature of Japanese censorship laws, the display of genitals, and even pubic hair, were long-held taboos in the genre. This restriction forced Japanese filmmakers to develop sometimes elaborate means of avoiding showing the &quot;working parts&quot;, as Richie puts it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richie-156&quot;/&gt; In order to work around this censorship, most Japanese directors positioned props—lamps, candles, bottles, etc.—at strategic locations to block the banned body parts. When this was not done, the most common alternative techniques are digital scrambling, covering the prohibited area with a black box or a fuzzy white spot, known as &quot;[[Fogging (censorship)|fogging]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser. p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have claimed that it is this [[censorship]] which gives the Japanese erotic cinema its particular style. Donald Richie says, &quot;American pornography is kept forever on its elemental level because, showing all, it need do nothing else; Japanese eroductions have to do something else since they cannot show all. The stultified impulse has created some extraordinary works of art, a few films among them.&quot; Writing in 1972, at the commencement of the Second Wave of ''pink film'', he qualifies his statement with, &quot;None of these, however, are found among eroductions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richie. ''The Japanese Eroduction''. p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting the ''pink film'' with Western [[pornographic film]]s, Pia Harritz says, &quot;What really stands out is the ability of pinku eiga to engage the spectator in more than just scenes with close-ups of genitals and finally the complexity in the representation of gender and the human mind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harritz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Harritz|first=Pia D|year=2006|title=Consuming the Female Body: Pinku Eiga and the case of Sagawa Issei |url=http://www.medievidenskab-odense.dk/index.php?id=57|work=[http://www.medievidenskab-odense.dk/ mediavidenskab]|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richie and Harritz both enumerate the fundamental elements of the ''pink film'' formula as:
# The film must have a required minimum quota of sex scenes&lt;ref&gt;Richie. ''The Japanese Eroduction'' p.159–160. &quot;In theory, directors are instructed to aim at some kind of sex scene every five minutes; in practice, however, it has proved almost impossible to construct a story-line which allows this, with the results that sex scenes are sometimes fewer but somewhat longer.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
# The film must be approximately one hour in duration&lt;ref&gt;Domenig. ''Vital Flesh''. &quot;Pink eiga... typically 60 minutes long...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
# It must be filmed on 16 mm or 35 mm film within one week&lt;ref&gt;Richie. ''The Japanese Eroduction'' p.157. &quot;The shooting-time for each remains short—a week at the most...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
# The film must be made on a very limited budget&lt;ref&gt;Harritz. Writing in 2006, Pia Harritz gives the required budget as about $35,000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the ''pink film''==
===Background to the ''pink film''===
[[File:Crazed Fruit poster 2.jpg|thumb|Poster for the ''taiyozoku''-themed ''[[Crazed Fruit]]'' (1956), a predecessor to the ''pink film'']]
In the years since the end of [[World War II]], eroticism had been gradually making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film—discreetly half-hidden by an umbrella—caused a national sensation in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=18 (Naked Dissent)|page=602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though throughout the 1940s and early 1950s nudity in Japanese movie theaters, as in most of the world, was a taboo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-22&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; some films from the mid-50s such as [[Shintoho]]'s female pearl-diver films starring buxom [[Michiko Maeda]], began showing more flesh than would have previously been imaginable in the Japanese cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson|first=Joseph|coauthors=Donald Richie|title=The Japanese Film: Art and Industry|origyear= |edition=Expanded|year=1982|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn= |pages=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, the ''[[taiyozoku]]'' films on the teen-age &quot;Sun Tribe&quot;, such as [[Kō Nakahira]]'s ''[[Crazed Fruit]]'' (1956), introduced unprecedented sexual frankness into Japanese films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sato|first=Tadao|authorlink=Tadao Sato|editor=Gregory Barrett (translator)|title=Currents in Japanese Cinema|origyear=1982|edition=paperback|year=1987|publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|pages=212–213|isbn=0-87011-815-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign films of this time, such as [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Summer with Monika]]'' (1953), [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[Les Amants]]'' (1958), and [[Russ Meyer]]'s ''[[The Immoral Mr. Teas]]'' (1959) introduced female nudity into international cinema, and were imported to Japan without problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-22&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel &quot;stag films,&quot; made illegally by underground film producers such as those depicted in [[Shohei Imamura|Imamura]]'s film ''[[The Pornographers]]'' (1966).&lt;ref name=&quot;Erotic Nightmares&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/focus_takechi.shtml|first=Jasper|last=Sharp|title=Tetsuji Takechi: Erotic Nightmares|accessdate=2007-03-15|work=www.midnighteye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first wave (The &quot;Age of Competition&quot; 1962–1971)===
The first wave of the ''Pink film'' in Japan was contemporary with the similar U.S. [[Sexploitation|sexploitation film]] genres, the &quot;nudie-cuties&quot; and &quot;roughies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fentone|first=Steve|year=1998|title=A Rip of the Flesh: The Japanese 'Pink Film' Cycle|journal=She|volume=2|issue=11|pages=p.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nudity and sex officially entered Japanese cinema with [[Satoru Kobayashi (director)|Satoru Kobayashi]]'s controversial and popular independent production ''[[Flesh Market]]'' (''Nikutai no Ichiba'', 1962), which is considered the first true ''pink film''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-21&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Made for 8 million yen, Kobayashi's independent feature film took in over 100 million yen. Kobayashi remained active in directing ''pink films'' until the 1990s. [[Tamaki Katori]], the star of the film, went on to become one of the leading early ''pink film'' stars, appearing in over 600, and earning the title &quot;Pink Princess&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryann|last=Connell|title=Japan's former Pink Princess trades raunchy scenes for rural canteen|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/03/20060302p2g00m0dm014000c.html|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[March 2]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1964, maverick ''[[kabuki]]'', theater and film director [[Tetsuji Takechi]] helped invigorate the &quot;First Wave&quot; of ''pink film'', by directing ''[[Daydream (1964 film)|Daydream]]'', the first big-budget ''pink film''. Takechi's ''Black Snow'' (1965), resulted in the director's arrest on charges of obscenity, and a high-profile trial which became a major battle between Japan's intellectuals and the establishment. Takechi won the lawsuit, and the publicity surrounding the trial helped bring about a boom in the production of ''pink films''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:249642|title=''Kuroi Yuki''|accessdate=2007-10-29|last=Firsching|first=Robert|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|quote= The resultant obscenity trial... ended with a landmark decision which allowed complete narrative freedom in Japanese films. This development paved the way for the thousands of softcore pinku eiga and S &amp; M films which would define Japanese exploitation cinema until... the late '80s...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In her introduction to the Weisser's ''Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films'', actress [[Naomi Tani]] calls this period in ''pink film'' production &quot;The Age of Competition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; Weisser, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Japan's major studios, such as [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Shochiku]] made occasional forays into ''pink film'' territory in the 1960s, such as director [[Seijun Suzuki]]'s ''[[Gate of Flesh]]'' (1964)—the first mainstream Japanese film to contain nudity,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-21&quot;/&gt; the ''pink films'' of this era were mainly independent, low-budget productions. Independent studios such as Nihon Cinema and World Eiga made dozens of cheap, profitable &quot;eroductions&quot;. Among the most influential independent studios producing ''pink films'' in this era were Shintoho, Million, Kanto, and Okura.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-20&quot;/&gt; Typically shown on a three-film program, these films were made by these companies to show at their own chain of specialty theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Richie. ''A Hundred Years of Japanese Film''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major ''pink film'' studio, Wakamatsu Studios, was formed by director [[Kōji Wakamatsu]] in 1965, after quitting Nikkatsu. Known as &quot;The Pink Godfather&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.287.&lt;/ref&gt; and called &quot;the most important director to emerge in the pink film genre&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Desser|first=David|title=Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington and Indianapolis|isbn=0-253-31961-7|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wakamatsu's independent productions are critically-respected works usually concerned with sex and extreme violence mixed with political messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Iwauchi|first=Hideki|coauthors=Koji Wakamatsu(interviewee)|url=http://www.insite-tokyo.com/interview/15wakamatsu/index.html|title=Koji Wakamatsu Film Director Interview |accessdate=2007-07-07|work=[http://www.insite-tokyo.com/ www.insite-tokyo.com]|quote=He... produced numerous films that are shocking for their treatments of sex, violence, and politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other important ''pink film'' directors of this time, [[Hiroshi Mukai]], [[Kinya Ogawa]] and [[Shinya Yamamoto]] are known as &quot;The Heroes of the First Wave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the same year as Wakamatsu became independent, directors Hiroshi Mukai and [[Giichi Nishihara]] established their own production companies-- Mukai Productions and Aoi Eiga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema|page= 53|year=2008|publisher=FAB Press|location=Guildford|isbn=978-1-903254-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;first queen of Japanese sex movies&quot; was [[Noriko Tatsumi]],&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt; who made films at World Eiga and Nihon Cinema with director [[Kōji Seki]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Other major Sex Queens of the first wave of ''pink film'' included [[Setsuko Ogawa]],&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Mari Iwai,&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.441.&lt;/ref&gt; Keiko Kayama,&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; and Miki Hayashi.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ''pink film'' stars of the era include Tamaki Katori, who appeared in many films for Giichi Nishihara and Kōji Wakamatsu; Kemi Ichiboshi, whose specialty was playing the role of a violated innocent;&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mari Nagisa.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt; Younger starlets like Naomi Tani, and [[Kazuko Shirakawa]] were starting their careers and already making names for themselves in the ''pink film'' industry, but are best remembered today for their work with Nikkatsu during the 1970s.

===The second wave (The Nikkatsu ''Roman Porno'' era 1971–1982)===
Until the late 1960s, the &quot;pink film&quot; market was almost entirely the domain of low-budget independent companies. At the beginning of the 1970s, now losing their audiences to television and imported American films, Japan's major film studios were struggling for survival. In 1972, Richie reported, &quot;In Japan, the eroduction is the only type of picture that retains an assured patronage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richie. ''The Japanese Eroduction'', p.158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to tap into this lucrative audience, major studio [[Toei Company|Toei]] entered the sexploitation market in 1971. In films like his ero-guro series and ''Joys of Torture'' series of the late 1960s director [[Teruo Ishii]] had provided a model for Toei's sexploitation ventures by &quot;establishing a queasy mix of comedy and torture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Macias, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Kanji Amao designed a group of series—''shigeki rosen'' (Sensational Line), ''ijoseiai rosen'' (Abnormal Line), and ''harenchi rosen'' (Shameless Line), today collectively referred to as Toei's &quot;Pinky Violence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Macias, p.189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;/&gt; Most of Toei's films in the ''pink film'' style used eroticism in conjunction with violent and action-filled stories. Several of these films have the theme of strong women exacting violent revenge for past injustices. The series was launched with the ''Delinquent Girl Boss'' (''Zubeko Bancho'') films starring [[Reiko Oshida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=D.|first=Chris|authorlink=Chris D.|title=Toei's Bad Girl Cinema (booklet to DVD set The Pinky Violence Collection|year=2005|publisher=Panik House Entertainment|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other series in the ''Pinky Violence'' genre included [[Norifumi Suzuki]]'s ''Girl Boss'' (''[[Sukeban]]'') films, and the ''[[Terrifying Girls' High School]]'' films, both starring [[Reiko Ike]] and [[Miki Sugimoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Macias, p.190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris D., p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Toei's films in this genre include [[Shunya Ito]]'s ''Sasori'' (Scorpion) series of [[women in prison films]] based on [[Toru Shinohara]]'s [[manga]]. Starting with ''[[Female Convict 701: Scorpion|Female Convict #701: Scorpion]]'' (1972), the ''Scorpion'' series starred [[Meiko Kaji]], who had left Nikkatsu Studios to distance herself from their ''Roman Porno'' series. 

Also in 1971, Takashi Itamochi, president of Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest major film studio, made the decision to take his own company's high production values and professional talent out of action films and put them into the ''pink film'' genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macias |first=Patrick |title=TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion |year=2001 |publisher=Cadence Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-56931-681-3|chapter=Nikkatsu's Roman Porno|page=187.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Toei, Nikkatsu had made some previous films in the sexploitation market, such as ''Story of Heresy in Meiji Era'' (1968) and ''Tokyo Bathhouse'' (1968), which featured over 30 sex-film stars in cameo appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.420, 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Nikkatsu launched its [[List of Nikkatsu Roman Porno films|''Roman Porno'' series]] in November 1971 with ''[[Apartment Wife: Affair In the Afternoon]]'', starring [[Kazuko Shirakawa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sato. p.244.&lt;/ref&gt; The film became a huge hit, inspired 20 sequels within seven years, establishing Shirakawa as Nikkatsu's first &quot;Queen&quot;, and successfully launched the high-profile ''Roman porno'' series. Director [[Masaru Konuma]] says that there was essentially no difference between the ''pink films'' and ''Roman Porno'' except for the studio's higher budget.&lt;ref&gt;[[Masaru Konuma|Konuma, Masaru]]. Interviewed by Weisser, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser.

However—from the creator's side—there was no difference between the making of Roman Porn and Pink.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Nikkatsu would make these higher-quality ''pink films'' almost exclusively, at an average rate of three per month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=Bye-Bye Pink Cinema, Hello Adult Video|page=603}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the next 17 years. 

Nikkatsu gave its ''Roman porno'' directors a great deal of artistic freedom in creating their films, as long as they met the official minimum quota of four nude or sex scenes per hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-204&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a series that was popular both with audiences and with critics.&lt;ref&gt;Macias, p.187. &quot;While single men and curious couples alike lined up for ''roman porno'' fare, film critics had no hesitations about singing their praises.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; One or two ''Roman Pornos'' appeared on the top-ten lists of Japanese critics every year throughout the run of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirano|first=Kyoko|editor=William Luhr|title=World Cinema Since 1945|year=1987|publisher=The Ungar Publishing Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-8044-3078-0|chapter=Japan|quote=at least one or two ''Roman Pornos'' have been chosen every year since 1971 as among the ten best films of the year by Japanese critics.|page=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikkatsu's higher-quality sex films essentially took the ''pink film'' market away from the smaller, independent studios until the mid-1980s, when the [[Chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] all but ended the theatrical pornographic film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-20&quot;/&gt;

[[Tatsumi Kumashiro]] was one of the major directors of the ''Roman Porno''. Kumashiro directed a string of financial and critical hits unprecedented in Japanese cinematic history, including ''[[Ichijo's Wet Lust]]'' (1972) and ''[[Woman with Red Hair]]'' (1979), starring Nikkatsu's second &quot;Queen&quot;, [[Junko Miyashita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-495&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.495.&lt;/ref&gt; He became known as the &quot;King of Nikkatsu ''Roman porno''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmquarterly.org/pdfs/article5701.pdf|title=A New View of Porn: The Films of Tatsumi Kumashiro|accessdate=2007-03-06 |last=Johnson|first=William|year=2003|format=PDF|work=[[Film Quarterly]], vol. 57, no.1, Fall 2003|publisher=University of California Press|pages=p.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-204&quot;/&gt; [[Noboru Tanaka]], director of ''[[A Woman Called Sada Abe]]'' (1975), is judged by many critics today to have been the best of Nikkatsu's ''Roman Porno'' directors.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, pp.323, 359.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson|first=Bill|editor=Frank N.

Theatrical pink movie profits dropped 36% within a month of the new ruling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-29&quot;/&gt; Eirin dealt the final blow to theatrical pornography in 1988 by introducing stricter requirements for sex-related theatrical films. Nikkatsu was finally forced to concede defeat to the AV industry, and closed its production facilities in April 1988. ''Bed Partner'' (1988) was the final film of the venerable 17-year-old ''Roman Porno'' series. Nikkatsu continued to distribute films under the name Ropponica, and theatrical pornography through Excess Films, however these were not nearly as popular or critically respected as the Roman Porno series had been in its heyday.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.30, 63, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1980s, the AV had become established as the main form of adult cinematic entertainment in Japan.

The dominant directors of ''pink films'' of the 1980s, [[Genji Nakamura]], [[Banmei Takahashi]] and [[Mamoru Watanabe]] are known collectively as &quot;The Three Pillars Of Pink&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; All three were veterans of the ''pink film'' industry since the 1960s. Coming to prominence in the 1980s, a time when the theatrical porn film was facing considerable difficulties on several fronts, this group is known for elevating the ''pink film'' above its low origins by concentrating on technical finesse and narrative content. Some critics dubbed the style of their films &quot;''pink'' art&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-495&quot;/&gt;

By the time Nakamura joined Nikkatsu in 1983, he had already directed over 100 films.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; While the plots of his films, which could be extremely misogynistic, were not highly respected, his visual style earned him a reputation for &quot;erotic sensitivity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-495&quot;/&gt; Nakamura directed one of Japan's first widely-distributed, well-received films with a homosexual theme, ''Legend of the Big Penis: Beautiful Mystery'' (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; for Nikkatsu's ENK Productions, which was founded in 1983 to focus on gay-themed ''pink films''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;/&gt; Some of Nakamura's later ''pink films'' were directed in collaboration with Ryuichi Hiroki, and Hitoshi Ishikawa under the group pseudonym Go Ijuin.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Banmei Takahashi directed &quot;intricate, highly stylistic ''pinku eiga''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; including ''New World of Love'' (1994), the first Japanese theatrical film to display genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.292.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent cult director of this era, [[Kazuo Komizu|Kazuo &quot;Gaira&quot; Komizu]], is known for his [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]]-influenced &quot;splatter-eros&quot; films, which bridge the genres of horror and erotica.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
Nikkatsu, Japan's largest producer of ''pink films'' during the 1970s and 1980s, declared bankruptcy in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Macias, p.188.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even in this most difficult period for the ''pink film'', the genre never completely died out, and continued exploring new artistic realms. Indeed, at this time the pink film was viewed as one of the last refuges of the &quot;[[Auteur theory|auteur]]&quot; in Japan. So long as the director provided the requisite number of sex scenes, he was free to explore his own thematic and artistic interests.&lt;ref&gt;Zeze, Takahisa quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/takahisa_zeze.shtml|title=Takahisa Zeze interview|accessdate=2007-10-04|work=[http://www.midnighteye.com/ midnighteye.com]|quote=Question: &quot;Pink film is often seen as one of the last few reserves of the auteur. It is often said that as long as you deliver so many sex scenes in one hour, the director can fill the rest of the running time with whatever he wants. Is this true?&quot; Zeze: &quot;Yes it is. We believed it was true at the time, so we tried to make what we wanted to make...&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the most prominent ''pink film'' directors of the 1990s, [[Kazuhiro Sano]], [[Toshiki Satō]] and [[Takahisa Zeze]] all made their directorial debuts in 1989. A fourth, [[Hisayasu Satō]], debuted in 1985. Coming to prominence during one of the most precarious times for the ''pink film'', these directors worked under the assumption that each film could be their last, and so largely ignored their audience to concentrate on intensely personal, experimental themes. These directors even broke one of the fundamental ''pink'' rules by cutting down in the sex scenes in pursuit of their own artistic concerns. Their films were considered &quot;difficult&quot;—dark, complex, and largely unpopular with the older ''pink'' audience. The title 
{{nihongo|&quot;Four Heavenly Kings of Pink&quot;|ピンク四天王|pinku shitenno}} was applied to these directors, at first sarcastically, by disgruntled theater owners. On the other hand, Roland Domenig, in his essay on the ''pink film'', says that their work offers &quot;a refreshing contrast to the formulaic and stereotyped films that make up the larger part of ''pink eiga'' production, and are strongly influenced by the notion of the filmmaker as auteur.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;/&gt;

===''Pink film'' today===
The newest prominent group of seven ''pink film'' directors all began as assistant directors to the ''shitenno''. Their films display individualistic styles and introspective character indicative of the insecurity of Japan's post-bubble generation. Known together as the {{nihongo|&quot;Seven Lucky Gods of Pink&quot;|ピンク七福神|shichifukujin}} they are [[Toshiya Ueno]], [[Shinji Imaoka]], [[Yoshitaka Kamata]], [[Toshiro Enomoto]], [[Yūji Tajiri]], [[Mitsuru Meike]] and [[Rei Sakamoto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;/&gt; Ueno was the first director of this group to rise to prominence, acting as an &quot;advance guard&quot; for the group when his ''[[Keep on Masturbating: Non-Stop Pleasure]]'' (1994) became the first film to win the &quot;Best Film&quot; award at the [[Pink Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, ''Behind the Pink Curtain'', p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pink Grand Prix has become a yearly highlight for the ''pink film'' community by awarding excellence in the genre and screening the top films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharp|first=Jasper|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20081204r1.html|title=Pink thrills: Japanese sex movies go global|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=January 23, 2009|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000s have seen a significant growth in international interest in the ''pink film''. Director Mitsuru Meike's ''[[The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai]]'' (2003) made an impression in international film festivals and gained critical praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fest06.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=35|title=THE GLAMOROUS LIFE OF SACHIKO HANAI|accessdate=2007-11-15|last=Armstrong|first=Rod|publisher=[[San Francisco International Film Festival]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A planned annual &quot;women-only&quot; ''pink film'' festival was first held in [[South Korea]] in 2007, and again in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinkfilm.co.kr/|title=2008 핑크영화제 (Pink Film Festival)|accessdate=2009-01-24|publisher=[http://www.pinkfilm.co.kr/ www.pinkfilm.co.kr]|year=2008|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mk.co.kr/se/view.php?sc=30000023&amp;cm=%EB%AC%B8%ED%99%94%C2%B7%EC%97%B0%EC%98%88%20%EC%A3%BC%EC%9A%94%EA%B8%B0%EC%82%AC&amp;year=2008&amp;no=629748&amp;selFlag=sc&amp;relatedcode=&amp;wonNo=&amp;sID=507|title=여성들을 위한 핑크영화 사천왕이 뜬다|accessdate=2009-03-15|publisher=[http://news.mk.co.kr/main/main_se.php news.mk.co.kr]|date=2008-10-15|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Park |first=Soo-mee|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i2366138689b4ccf34478050b7dd49493|title=Erotic film fest pushes the envelope in Korea: Pink Film Festival celebrates Japanese erotic satire|accessdate=2009-06-20|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 a company called Pink Eiga was formed with the sole purpose of releasing ''pink films'' on DVD in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Grady|last=Hendrix|url=http://varietyasiaonline.com/kaijushakedown/PINK-EIGA|title=Pink Eiga|accessdate=2009-01-24|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date-2009-01-14|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tamakeri''''' (玉蹴り)(lit. '''''ball kicking''''') is a Japanese [[sexual fetish]] and sub-genre in which a female kicks, knees, punches, grabs or twists a man's [[testicles]].  This act is often shown in [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] [[horror films]], such as ''Busted Balls''.&lt;ref name = Mainichi&gt;{{cite news | url = http://cid-88684d2bf683ba51.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/mainichi/moto/2002/2002.09/New%20adult%20videos%20deal%20a%20low%20blow%20to%20manhood.pdf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;sa=19585965 | format = pdf | title = New adult videos deal a low blow to manhood | work = [[Mainichi Shimbun|''Mainichi Daily News'']] | date = 2002-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tamakeri videos cater mainly to [[Sadism and masochism|masochistic]] men for whom the idea of having their testicles abused is sexually stimulating, at least in [[fantasy]]. In pornographic tamakeri videos the repeated genital attacks are invariably followed by sexual activity.&lt;ref name = Mainichi/&gt; 

The genre appeals primarily to men, but does have has some female following in Japan and elsewhere. Female performers generally are young, out-of-work models or actresses who appear in these videos only occasionally. Male performers are often masochists who apply to work in the videos.&lt;ref name = Mainichi/&gt;

{{nihongo|''[[Omorashi]]''|オモラシ / おもらし / お漏らし}} is a [[fetish subculture]] recognized predominantly in Japan, in which participants experience arousal from having a full bladder or a sexual attraction to someone else experiencing the feeling of a full bladder. For such fetishists, climax usually coincides with the moment of relief and embarrassment experienced when the desperate individual loses bladder control and experiences [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. Its popularity with [[otaku]] culture has caused it to be featured in a number of [[anime]] and [[manga]] titles. Some focus exclusively on omorashi stories, and could be considered a form of [[H manga]]. Others may simply feature the occasional scene. Emphasis on ''[[moe (slang)|moe]]'' attitudes in omorashi are usually apparent by the characteristic large eyes and small simple nose of the wetters. This emphasis on childish helplessness sometimes manifests itself through [[loli]] and [[shotacon]] elements as well.

[[Image:Dream of the fishermans wife hokusai.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', a design by [[Hokusai]] of 1814 depicting a woman engaging in sex with a pair of octopuses.]]
[[Image:Tamatori being pursued bya dragon.jpg|thumb|300px|Tamatori steals the Dragon King's jewel, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]


'''Tentacle rape''' or '''shokushu goukan''' (触手強姦) is a concept found in some [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[hentai]] titles, where various [[tentacle]]d creatures (usually fictional monsters) [[rape]] or otherwise penetrate women, anthropomorphous creatures, [[Futanari]] and less commonly men. The genre is quite popular in Japanese [[erotica]], and is even the subject of much [[parody]].  
==History==
Tentacled creatures appeared in Japanese erotica long before animated pornography. Among the most famous of the early instances -- and perhaps the first -- is an illustration from the novel 'Kinoe no komatsu' of 1814 by Katsushika [[Hokusai]]. It is a celebrated example of [[shunga]] (Japanese erotic art) and has been reworked by a number of artists. [[Australia]]n artist [[David Laity]] reworked the design into a painting of the same name, and [[Masami Teraoka]] brought the image up to date with his 2001 work &quot;Sarah and Octopus/Seventh Heaven,&quot; part of his ''Waves and Plagues'' collection.

A scholarly paper by Danielle Talerico&lt;ref&gt;Talerico, Danielle. “Interpreting Sexual Imagery in Japanese Prints: A Fresh Approach to Hokusai’s Diver and Two Octopi,” in ''Impressions, The Journal of the Ukiyo-e Society of America'', Vol. 23 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; showed that although western audiences have often interpreted Hokusai’s famous design as rape, Japanese audiences of the Edo period would have associated it with the legend of the female [[abalone]] diver Tamatori. In the story, Tamatori steals a jewel from the Dragon King. However, during her egress, the Dragon King and his sea-life minions (including octopi) pursue her. Furthermore, within the dialogue in the illustration itself, the diver and two octopuses express mutual enjoyment.

==Culture==
[[Toshio Maeda]]’s manga ''[[Urotsukidoji]]'' created what might be called the modern paradigm of tentacle porn, in which the elements of sexual assault are emphasized. Maeda explained that he invented the practice to get around strict [[Japan]]ese [[censorship]] regulations, which prohibit the depiction of the [[penis]] but apparently do not prohibit showing sexual penetration by a tentacle or similar (often robotic) appendage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although [[pornography in Japan]] has a long history and is a major business, until recently, the [[adult video]] industry did not develop a broad-based set of awards for sales or performance such as the [[AVN Awards]] in American pornography.

That has changed in recent years, and the two primary awards given at present (which are covered in separate articles) are the [[AV Grand Prix]] for retail and internet videos and the [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] for programs broadcast on Japanese satellite TV.

This text is focused on the various earlier Japanese adult video awards given in the period 1991-2007, none of which are presently active except for the Moodyz Awards. Some were given only infrequently and many were limited to particular studios or groups of companies.

==Tokyo Sports Film Awards (1991-1999)==
The [[Tokyo Sports Film Awards]] (東京スポーツ映画大賞) are sponsored by the Japanese tabloid newspaper [[Tokyo Sports]]. The award ceremonies are held in January for movies in the previous year. The first awards were given in 1991 for the 1990 cinema year. The awards were for mainstream movies but occasionally awards were also given for adult video work. The sometimes idiosyncratic selections were made by famed filmmaker and actor [[Takeshi Kitano]]. Adult awards ended with the establishment of the Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ts1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/tsmp/index.html|title=東京スポーツ映画大賞 (Tokyo Sports Film Awards)|accessdate=2008-11-16|publisher=[http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/ Tokyo Sports]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ts2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/tsmp/movie.htm|title=東京スポーツ映画大賞 過去の受賞者、作品一覧 (Tokyo Sports Film Awards - Winners)|accessdate=2008-11-16|publisher=[http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/ Tokyo Sports]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ts3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/tsmp/backnumber.html|title=東スポ映画大賞 過去の授賞一覧 (Tokyo Sports Film Awards - Summary)|accessdate=2008-11-16|publisher=[http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/ Tokyo Sports]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entomolonooky.jpg|thumb|Ero guro]]
{{nihongo|'''Ero Guro Nansensu''', frequently shorted to '''Ero guro''', |エログロ|ero-guro}} is a [[wasei-eigo]] term that describes a literary and artistic movement from 1920s and '30s Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucla&quot;&gt;Silverberg, Miriam Rom. [http://www.history.ucla.edu/silverberg/Document3.pdf &quot;By Way of a Preface: Defining ''Erotic Grotesque  Nonsense''&quot;]. Galley copy of the preface for ''Erotic Grotesque Nonsense: The Mass Culture of Japanese Modern Times''. December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ero guro puts its focus on eroticism, sexual corruption and decadence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucla&quot; /&gt;  This movement is often used incorrectly by western audiences to mean &quot;gore&quot;—depictions of horror, blood, and guts. In actuality the &quot;grotesque&quot; term implies malformed, unnatural or horrific.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucla&quot; /&gt;  While ero guro is a specific movement, many of its components can be found throughout Japanese history and culture. Items that are pornographic and bloody are not necessarily ero guro.

==History==
Ero guro nansensu, characterized as a &quot;prewar, bourgeois cultural phenomenon that devoted itself to explorations of the deviant, the bizarre, and the ridiculous,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reichert | first = Jim | title = Deviance and Social Darwinism in Edogawa Ranpo's Erotic-Grotesque Thriller Koto no Ōni | journal = Journal of Japanese Studies | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = pp. 113–114 | date = 2001 | doi = 10.2307/3591938}}&lt;/ref&gt; manifested in the popular culture of [[Taishō period|Taishō]] Tokyo during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buruma&quot;&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ian Buruma|last=Buruma|first=Ian|title=Inventing Japan, 1853–1964|pages=67–68|year=2003|publisher=The Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=0-679-64085-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Ian Buruma]] describes the social atmosphere of the time as &quot;a skittish, sometimes nihilistic hedonism that brings [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] Berlin to mind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buruma&quot;/&gt; Its roots go back to erotic [[shunga]] artists like [[Yoshitoshi]], whose mid-1860s woodblock printings showed decapitations and acts of violence from Japanese history. [[Ukiyo-e]] artists such as [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] presented similar themes with bondage, rape, and erotic [[crucifixion]].

Ero guro's first distinct appearance began in 1920s and 1930s [[Japanese literature]]. The [[Sada Abe|Sada Abe Incident]] of 1936, where a woman [[Erotic asphyxiation|choked]] and [[castration|castrated]] her lover, struck a chord with the ero guro movement, and came to represent that genre for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston|first=William|title=Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|language=English|isbn=0-231-13052-X|pages=11, 114, 160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other activities and movements were generally suppressed in Japan during [[World War II]], but re-emerged in the postwar period, especially in [[manga]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark. [http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue12/mclelland.html &quot;A Short History of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Hentai''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the ero guro movement's influence expanded into parts of Japanese [[Theatre of Japan|theatre]], [[Japanese art|art]], [[manga]], and eventually film and music.

==Later influences==
Ero guro is also an element of many Japanese horror films and ''[[Pink film|pinku eiga]]'', particularly of the 1960s and 1970s. Examples include [[Teruo Ishii]]'s ''[[Shogun's Joys of Torture]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]) and ''[[Horrors of Malformed Men]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]) and [[Yasuzo Masumura]]'s ''Blind Beast'' (盲獣, 1969), the latter two based on the works of [[Edogawa Rampo]]. A more recent example of ero guro in cinema is [[Sion Sono]]'s ''Strange Circus'' (奇妙なサーカス, 2005).

There are modern guro artists, some of whom cite Erotic Grotesque Nonsense as an influence on their work. These artists explore the macabre intermingled with sexual overtones. Often the erotic element, even when not explicit, is merged with grotesque themes and features similar to the works of [[H. R. Giger]]. Others produce ero guro as a genre of [[Japan]]ese [[pornography]] and [[hentai]] involving [[blood]], [[Disembowelment|gore]], [[disfiguration]], [[violence]], [[Body integrity identity disorder|mutilation]], [[Urolagnia|urine]], [[Klismaphilia|enemas]], or [[Coprophilia|feces]].

Examples of well-known guro ''[[mangaka]]'' include [[Suehiro Maruo]], [[Shintaro Kago]], [[Jun Hayami]], [[Toshio Maeda]], [[Henmaru Machino]], [[Horihone Saizō]], and [[Waita Uziga]].

The modern genre of [[tentacle rape]] began within the category of ero guro (although it has much older roots in Japanese art; see ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]''), but was so popular that it is now usually considered separately.

==In music==
[[Visual kei]] bands frequently have a concept or theme relating to ero guro, some calling it a subgenre of visual kei. The band [[Cali Gari]] was heavily influenced by Erotic Grotesque Nonsense and Angura.&lt;ref name=&quot;bounce.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.bounce.com/article/article.php/3419/2/ Bounce ''Di(s)ctionary Number 13 - Visual Kei'']. Retrieved November 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western visual kei fans mistook this theme as a description of their &quot;genre&quot; and linked it with other visual kei bands.

===Nikkatsu and Roman Porno===
[[Image:Nikkatsu-gp-004.jpg|thumb|300px|Japanese porn star Kaori Asou from the Nikkatsu's Roman Porno film ''The Orgasms'' (1986)]]
In the late 1960s, the ''[[pink film]]'', or adult film market in Japan was largely the realm of low-budget independent companies. With their audience being lost to television and the importation of American films, Nikkatsu, Japan's major film studios were struggling for survival. Seeking to attract a new audience, [[Toei Company|Toei]] entered the sexploitation market in 1971 with its &quot;Pinky Violence&quot; series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-02-18|last=Domenig|first=Roland|year=2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041118094603/http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|archivedate=2004-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takashi Itamochi, president of Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest major film studio, made the decision to put the company's high production values and professional talent into the adult, or ''pink film'' industry as a way of attracting a new audience. When Nikkatsu launched its Roman Porno series in November 1971 with the ''Apartment Wife'' series, these often well-made and artistic softcore pornographic films proved popular with both the public and the critics. This introduction of pornography into mainstream Japanese movie theaters has been credited with saving Nikkatsu from collapse at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sato|first=Tadao|editor=Gregory Barrett (translator)|title=Currents in Japanese Cinema|origyear=1982|edition=paperback|year=1987|publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|language=English|page=244|isbn=0-87011-815-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikkatsu produced nothing but ''Roman Porno'' films for the next 17 years, releasing an average of three such films a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|pages=603|chapter=Bye-Bye Pink Cinema, Hello Adult Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large studios such as [[Shintoho]] and Million Films would follow Nikkatsu into the big-budget ''pink film'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-88928-852-7|pages=29|chapter=Fogging, Editing and Censorship: Japanese Cinema is a Dichotomy of Artistic Freedom and Repression}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Nikkatsu remained the dominant producer of high-production theatrical pornography in Japan. By the end of the 1970s, Nikkatsu's ''Roman Porno'' together with ''pink films'' by other companies made up over 70% of the domestic Japanese film market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;/&gt;

===Background to AVs of the 1980s===
Ownership of VCRs first became widespread in Japan in the early 1980s, and this was the dawn of the Japanese AV (Adult Video) industry. Immediately after their debut, these adult videos proved successful with the public. The AVs provided privacy and comfort that the older, established theatrical pornography market could not. Also, [[Patrick Macias]] points out that AVs were better able to focus on niche-interests, and provided the convenience of the fast-forward button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macias|first=Patrick|title=TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion|year=2001|publisher=Cadence Books|location=San Francisco|language=English|isbn=1-56931-681-3|pages=176|chapter=Pink and Violent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s thus became a struggle for the attention of the pornography audience in Japan between the AV industry and the producers of theatrical pornography, the largest of which was the [[Nikkatsu]] studio. Due to changing audience loyalties and increased government restrictions on theatrical films, by the end of the decade the AV industry had emerged as the leader of the pornographic marketplace in Japan.

===AV's competition with Nikkatsu===
When ownership VCRs first became widespread in the early 1980s, the AVs made their appearance and quickly became highly popular. As soon as 1982 the AVs had already attained an approximately equal share of the adult entertainment market with theatrical erotic films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser, p.29&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the late 1960s, Nikkatsu had again found itself losing its audience, this time to the new AV market. Faced with this new competition over the cinematic adult entertinment audience, Nikkatsu focused on continued production of its S&amp;M films, which had been their most popular product. In 1984, new government policies and an agreement between [[Eirin]] (the Japanese film-rating board) and the ''pink film'' companies put drastic new restrictions on theatrical films. Theatrical ''pink film'' profits dropped 36% within a month of the new ruling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser, p.29&quot;/&gt; The studio at first tried to circumvent the new theatrical rules and to compete directly with the AVs by entering their own turf. To launch the company's new &quot;Harder Than Pink&quot; AV series, Nikkatsu wanted [[Masaru Konuma]], director of the highly popular and critically-praised 1974 Roman Porno ''[[Wife to be Sacrificed]]'', to make a hard-core version of his script ''Woman in the Box'' (箱の中の女 - ''Hako No Naka No Onna'') in 1985. Konuma was at first reluctant, but Nikkatsu was able to persuade him to make the video by agreeing to allow Konuma to direct his original (and, according to the Weissers, artistically superior) version of this script for theatrical release the following year. However, Nikkatsu soon ceased production of this video series when it proved unsuccessful with the public.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p. 30, 334, 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio next tried to tempt audiences back to the theater with higher-caliber ''pink films'', beginning with the ''Flower and Snake'' (Hana To Hebi) series (1985-1987), based on its 1974 Roman Porno S/M hit ''[[Flower and Snake]]'', starring [[Naomi Tani]]. When this failed, they hired AV queen '''[[Hitomi Kobayashi]]''' (debut 1986 - see list below) to star in her own theatrical film series in 1987, but these films were judged as little more than AVs on film, and were not popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser, p.155, 221-222&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.155, 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Nikkatsu's loss to the AV industry===
After all these strategies by Nikkatsu proved unsuccessful, Eirin dealt the final blow by introducing stricter requirements for sex-related theatrical films. The company was finally forced to concede defeat to the AV industry, and closed its production facilities in April 1988. ''Bed Partner'' (1988) was the final film of the venerable 17-year-old Roman Porno series.

===1986===
1986 was a turning-point year for the AV industry due to two actresses who debuted this year. '''[[Hitomi Kobayashi]]''' and '''[[Kaoru Kuroki]]''' became major AV stars who would shape the future of the AV market.

'''Hitomi Kobayashi''''s career in the AV field would last for over a decade and a half, earning her the title &quot;Japan's Queen of Adult Video.&quot; Her 39 AVs sold over 600,000 copies, earning about 6 billion yen. According to the adult entertainment editor for ''Shukan Shincho'', &quot;She laid the foundations for the golden age of adult video.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seeks investors&quot; &gt;{{cite news|title=Porno queen seeks investors' plug as she goes out with a bang|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/07/20030718p2g00m0dm999000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060107135116/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/07/20030718p2g00m0dm999000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[July 18]], [[2003]]|archivedate=2006-01-07|accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became admired by women for her outspoken but polite and frank discussions of sex, and for expressing &quot;feminist&quot; views on television. According to Rosemary Iwamura, she changed the image of the AV actress. &quot;...she didn't seem to be making videos because of a lack of options but rather as an informed choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/7.2/Iwamura.html|title=Letter from Japan: From Girls Who Dress Up Like Boys To Trussed-up Porn Stars - Some of the Contemporary Heroines on the Japanese Screen|accessdate=2007-02-18|last=Iwamura|first=Rosemary|year=1994|publisher=Continuum: The Australian Journal of Media &amp; Culture, vol. 7 no. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuroki's director at Crystal, Toru Muranishi, became known as an industry innovator who helped create the documentary-style format which would become a trademark of Japanese AVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornoff 608&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|pages=608|chapter=18 (Naked Dissent)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1987===
In an attempt to compete with the AV industry, Nikkatsu hired AV queen '''[[Hitomi Kobayashi]]''', who had debuted the previous year, to star in her own theatrical film series in 1987. These films were not popular with AV fans, who preferred the privacy the AV offered, or with movie-goers, who judged them as little more than AVs on film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser, p.155, 221-222&quot;/&gt;

'''[[Nao Saejima]]''', who debuted in 1987, would star in self-titled theatrical releases for Nikkatsu, the ''[[pink film]]'', ''Abnormal Excitement: Nao Saejima'' (1989), and the mainstream ''Meet Me In the Dream: Wonderland'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 article reported that Saejima was then working as an artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inspiring second&quot; &gt;{{cite news|first=Masuo|last=Kamiyama|title=Porn starlets move on to inspiring second careers|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071231090149/mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[January 7]], [[2006]]|archivedate=2007-12-31|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prolific ''[[pink film]]'' actor '''[[Yutaka Ikejima]]''' entered the directing profession in 1988 through the AV medium. He would eventually move into directing theatrical ''[[pink film]]s'' in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.190.&lt;/ref&gt; earning several awards at the [[Pink Grand Prix]] through the years for his contributions to that genre.

Nikkatsu ended its 17-year theatrical Roman Porno series in 1988, conceding defeat to the AV market.

Diamond Visual, which would become the largest AV company for a while, was founded in September 1988 by Toru Muranishi. Muranishi had worked at Crystal Eizo when '''[[Kaoru Kuroki]]''' made her debut there in 1986. Sharing his vision of documentary-style AVs, Kuroki followed Muranishi to his new company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornoff 608&quot;/&gt;

===AVs in the 1990s===
The 1990s opened with the government lifting its 40-year ban on pubic hair in print. According to the Weissers, &quot;by mid-1991, full frontal nudity became commonplace in Japanese magazines and books.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The restriction on pubic hair in film and video had been relaxed for imported films, but remained in place for domestic films and AVs until the middle of the decade.
===1990===
The {{nihongo|&quot;Big Bust Boom&quot;|巨乳ブーム|Kyonyu Buumu}} which became a significant genre of the AV market with '''[[Kimiko Matsuzaka]]''''s debut early the previous year, continued in 1990. Matsuzaka would appear in her last AV in October 1990, and retire from public life in 1991. Among the leading busty models who debuted this year was Kuwata Kei, whose 113&amp;nbsp;cm bust measurement was the first in the AV industry to surpass Matsuzaka's advertised 110.7-centimeter metric G-cup. Though never as popular as Matsuzaka, Kuwata's career would last until at least 1998.

'''[[Kimiko Matsuzaka]]''''s sudden retirement from public life in the spring of 1991 came as a shock to the AV industry.

Actress [[Rie Miyazawa]]'s ''shashinshuu'' (photo book) ''[[Santa Fe (nude photo book)|Santa Fe]]'', released in November 1991, was one of the first photo books to take advantage of the lifting of the long-standing ban on the showing of pubic hair.

The major film studio, [[Shintoho]] entered the AV (adult video) market in 1992 with its &quot;Hard Porno&quot; series. This was a line of video-releases of older [[Koji Wakamatsu]]-produced S&amp;M films. The series opened with the [[Shinya Yamamoto]]-directed [[Naomi Tani]] film ''Cruelty of the Female Inquisition'' (1975). Wakamatsu's own ''Torture Chronicles'' were released to video in this series.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1995, [[Ganari Takahashi]] founded the AV company [[Soft On Demand]], which would become the largest independent adult video company in Japan and notable for its creative approach to adult videos.

Until the mid-1990s, AV actress were almost exclusively models in their late teens or early 20s at the time of their debuts.

Ruka Aida was one of the most popular 1995 AV debuts, and became known for refusing to allow her male partners to wear condoms in spite of industry concerns over [[AIDS]].

'''[[Kei Mizutani]]'''s debut in ''Weather Girl'' was one of the surprise successes in Japanese cinema of the 1990s. Released to video in 1995, the film quickly developed a cult-following. The video won the [[Oslo Films from the South Festival|Oslo]] and the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]]s in 1996, causing the video producer to take the unprecedented step of pulling the video from the market to release it theatrically in Japan. It went on to box-office success, and topped several critics' Top Ten lists for the year. The Weissers call it, &quot;a brilliant film, worthy of all the praise it received from some traditionally conservative reviewers, constantly flirting with bad taste while managing to stay fresh and innocent,&quot; and point out that the film, &quot;dramatically illustrates the enormous cultural differences between Japanese and American sensibilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-ISBN 1-88928-852-7|pages=492–493|chapter=Weather Girl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizutani would go on to a prolific career and international popularity.

'''Dogma''' (ドグマ ) is a Japanese [[adult video]] company which specializes in various fetish genres of pornography. The Dogma label was formed as part of the [[Soft On Demand]] (SOD) group in February 2001 by [[Tohjiro]], a director at SOD. A year later, Tohjiro separated Dogma from SOD to become a separate &quot;indie&quot; producer of AV material. Tohjiro said he liked the sound of the word &quot;Dogma&quot; and decided to use it for his label. The studio produces about 8 new titles a month, about half of them directed by Tohjiro. The company's products are distributed as downloadable videos through their website and as DVDs through the [[Hokuto Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/tinyd2/index.php?id=17|title=What Is Dogma?|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to video production, Dogma has also made a small foray into the [[T-Shirt]] business with some designs by [[AV Idol]] [[Kurumi Morishita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20050329A/| title=ファンならいっそ死に装束に！（言い過ぎ）　森下くるみちゃんＴシャツ対決 (Burial outfit for fans! - Exaggeration - Kurumi Morishita T-shirts)|accessdate=2009-03-02|date=March 29, 2005|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://core-choco.shop-pro.jp/?mode=cate&amp;cbid=255656&amp;csid=0| title=Hardcore Chocolate T-Shirt Store|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogma is incorporated as OM Production, Inc. (株式会社オムプロダクション) with Muneyuki Mikami (三上宗之) as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The company has its offices and studios in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Roppongi]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/tinyd2/index.php?id=21|title=Company Information|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-02-26|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Series and labels==
Dogma specializes in extreme videos depicting various fetish genres including [[anal sex]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]], forced [[fellatio]] and vomiting, enemas, [[Urolagnia|watersports]] and [[Coprophilia|scat]]. One of Dogma's longest running series is the S&amp;M &quot;M-Drug&quot; (Mドラッグ) series directed by [[Tohjiro]] and begun in September 2005 with [[Mayura Hoshitsuki]]. Another Tohjiro series is &quot;Confinement Chair Trance&quot; (拘束椅子トランス) which started up in November 2002. Tohjiro is also the director of the &quot;Innocent Desire&quot; (青い性欲) lolita-genre series which premiered in March 2001 when Dogma was still part of SOD. Another extensive series is the [[Futanari|&quot;Hermaphrodite&quot;]] (ふたなり) set of videos directed by Hitoshi Nimura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/search_d.php?dat=18&amp;pd=download|title=Series|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;javnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=89|title=JAV News - Popular Series and Actors from Dogma Studio|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]|month=August |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jans-web.com/?p=series&amp;sid=86|title=Film Series: Dogma - Confinement Chair Trance 拘束椅子トランス|accessdate=2009-03-03|publisher=[http://www.jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Dogma videos have been released under the Dogma label but [[Tohjiro]] instituted a separate hardcore S&amp;M themed label, CORE SM, in December 2005 with its first release being ''Maki Tomoda - Bound Masochistic Slave''. Another label, Shyness, was started in November 2007 to continue the &quot;Innocent Desire&quot; lolita-genre series and a third label, Dogma Out, was used in 2005 and 2006 mostly by director Baba the Babee. The CORE label uses the production code series COT-xxx, Shyness uses DDH-xxx, and Dogma Out uses ODD-xxx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/search_d.php?dat=4&amp;pd=download|title=Label|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==D-1 Climax Awards==
Dogma sponsored the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#Dogma D-1 Climax Awards (2005-2007)|D-1 Climax]] (D-1　クライマックス) awards, which ran from 2005 to 2007, as a competition for directors. Several prominent directors from Dogma and other companies were invited to make videos under the Dogma label and sales during a set period plus voting by judges were used to determine the winners of the contest. Director and founder [[Tohjiro]] won the award in 2005 and 2006 but Hitoshi Nimura took the prize in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20061224A/index3.htm| title=最エロな監督と女優が決定！Ｄ１クライマックス授賞式 (Porn Actresses &amp; Best Director - D-1 Climax Ceremony)|accessdate=2008-11-20|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ All About]|date=December 24, 2006|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/d-1/products/results.html|title=D-1 Climax Director's 1 Results|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|accessdate=2008-11-20|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AV GrandPrix==
Dogma had not participated in the [[AV Open]] contests in 2006 and 2007 but with the ending of the D-1 Climax Awards, Dogma did enter a video in the Maniac Stage of the 2008 [[AV GrandPrix]], a compilation from [[Tohjiro]]'s M-Drug series ''Best of M Drug - Female Meat Toilet'' (Mドラッグ・スペシャル 女体肉便器ベスト) [AVGL-019].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/avgp/sp/mania_list.html|title=AV Grand Prix 2008 Mania Stage|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|accessdate=2008-10-05|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2009 AV GrandPrix competition, the Dogma entry was another Tohjiro production, ''Vomit Enema Ecstasy X'' (ゲロ浣腸エクスタシー Ｘ) [AVGL-130] starring [[Mayura Hoshitsuki]] and Yuka Oosawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-gp.com/works/avgl130/bottom.html|title=Dogma Entry|publisher=[http://www.av-gp.com/ www.av-gp.com]|accessdate=2009-03-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tohjiro made some waves by declaring all-out war by the small &quot;indie&quot; producer Dogma to defeat last year's champion, top studio [[S1 No. 1 Style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/AVGP2009/index.html|title=AVGP 2009|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-03-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although S1 did take the GrandPrix top prize and several others, Tohjiro made good on part of his boast - the Dogma video won the Digital Sales Award and the 2 million yen (about $20,000) prize money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-gp.com/news/avgp_result/bottom.html|title=AVGP 2009 Result announcement|publisher=[http://www.av-gp.com/ www.av-gp.com]|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2002 party had 400 guests and by 2003 the number had risen to 700 and then to over 1000 for the 2005 event. Guests included actresses and staff, managers, friends, and the press. The party was also the venue for the annual [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#Moodyz Awards (2001-2008)|Moodyz Awards]] celebrating the work of Moodyz actresses and directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodyz.com/free/mdz_grandprize/|title=MOODYZ忘年会レポート|publisher=[http://www.moodyz.com/ MOODYZ]|accessdate=2009-02-11|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mblog.dmm.co.jp/moodyz/event/2006/01/|title=ＭＯＯＤＹＺ年末大感謝祭'０５　レポート|accessdate=2009-02-10)|publisher=[http://www.moodyz.com/ MOODYZ]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dream School'' (ドリーム学園) or ''Dream Gakuen'' series is one of Moodyz oldest, best selling and most honored set of videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;series&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodyz.com/shop/dvd_shop/-/list/=/article=series/id=3/|title=シリーズ：ドリーム学園 (Dream School Series)|publisher=[http://www.moodyz.com/ Moodyz]|accessdate=2009-02-13|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume was released in July 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkikaku.jp/b/D-OV4.html|title=中古DVD　=MOODYZ（オムニバス）=|publisher=[http://www.nkikaku.jp/ www.nkikaku.jp]|accessdate=2009-02-13|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Moodyz had been in existence only a little over a year. ''Dream School 2'' and ''Dream School 5'' were the 2001 and 2002 winners of the Grand Prize Moodyz Award at the annual Moodyz Awards while ''Dream School 7'' won the 2003 award for most sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodyz.com/free/mdz_grandprize/taisyo/index_2003.html|title=2003年MOODYZ大賞|accessdate=2009-02-10)|publisher=[http://www.moodyz.com/ www.moodyz.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 ''Dream School 10'' was the Moodyz entry in the [[AV Open]] contest where it took the 2nd Place Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20060712A/index.htm|title=速報！AV OPEN結果発表 (Preliminary AV Open results)|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ All About]|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|date=July 12, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 2007, Moodyz nominated another entry in the series, ''Dream School 11'', for the AV Open where it won the 3rd Place Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/avopen/avopen02_result.html|title=2nd AV Open Results|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|accessdate=2008-10-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has continued with ''Dream School 12'' released in June 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;series&quot;/&gt;

The ''Dream School'' videos, all directed by Takei Shimizu, have usually been major productions running 3 or 4 hours and having a large cast of actors and actresses. They are plotted as dramas taking place in a high-school setting and include a medley of porn genres including bukkake, gokkun, [[S&amp;M]], simulated rape, [[urolagnia]], anal sex, [[orgies]] and even occasionally [[coprophilia|scat]] and [[bestiality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;series&quot;/&gt; Several AV stars have appeared in the series including [[Bunko Kanazawa]], Izumi Seika, [[Nao Oikawa]], [[Chihiro Hasegawa]], [[Mayura Hoshitsuki]], [[Hotaru Akane]] and Chihiro Hara.&lt;ref name=&quot;series&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Ganari Takahashi'''|高橋がなり|Takahashi Ganari}} is an entrepreneur in the field of Japanese [[adult video]] (AV). He founded [[Soft On Demand]] (SOD), one of the largest porn conglomerates in Japan.

==Life and career==
Takahashi, whose real name is Masaya Takahashi (高橋 雅也), was born in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]] in 1958. After graduating from high school he went to work as a driver for the Sagawa Express Co. where he made himself into the best driver in the company. In 1981 he joined the TV production company IVS where he worked for Terry Itoh ([[:ja:テリー伊藤]]) directing shows such as ''Tensai Takeshi no Genki ga deru TV'' (Genius Takeshi’s Exhilarating TV Show). He also later worked at a Chinese restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elevenarts.net/Feature/Titles/OhMyZombie/OhMyZombieMermaid.pdf|title=Oh! My Zombie Mermaid|publisher=[http://www.elevenarts.net/ www.elevenarts.net]|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xonge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xonge.com/?tag=ganari-takahashi|title=Ganari Takahashi|publisher=[http://xonge.com/ XONGE]|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SOD===
Takahashi used 10 million Yen (about $100,000) borrowed from Itoh to invest in two companies, one in golf-related goods and the other in the apparel business, but both failed. About that time, an AV company with about 10 employees was on the edge of bankruptcy and Takahashi with help from Itoh was able to use the company as the basis for the foundation of [[Soft On Demand]] (SOD) in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;xonge&quot;/&gt;  Takahashi was able to grow SOD into a major company, from sales of 300 million yen (about $3 million) in 1996 to 6 billion yen (about $60 million) by 2001 and to 9 billion yen (about $90 million) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://softondemand.jp/corporate/company/data.html|title=SOD Company Data|publisher=[http://softondemand.jp/ SOD]|accessdate=2008-12-09|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the company had a staff of 180 and was generating profits of 1.5 billion yen (about $15 million) on sales from 1000 titles a year. Takahashi's plan was to increase market share and to absorb or eliminate competition from the hundreds of other AV manufacturers by producing high quality products at lower prices (&quot;We want to spend money making good movies that we can sell cheaply&quot;) and by removing some of the stigma attached to adult products (&quot;I want people to know that there's nothing dirty about adult videos&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;japaninc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=1188|title=The Ray Kroc of Adult Video|publisher=[http://www.japaninc.com/ Japan Inc]|accessdate=2009-04-01|last=McNeill|first=David|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;offbeat&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Offbeat erotica pumps porno-maker into big time|last=Connell|first=Ryann|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2001/06/20010605p2g00m0dm999000c.html|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=June 5, 2001|accessdate=2007-03-06}} This source is no longer available but a copy of the article can be accessed at http://cid-88684d2bf683ba51.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/mainichi/moto/2001/2001.06/Offbeat%20erotica%20pumps%20porno-maker%20into%20big%20time.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Takahashi, who has been described as &quot;strong-willed&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;works&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmate.com/reviews/article_123.html|title=The Collection of Works ~ Ganari Takahashi|publisher=[http://www.jmate.com/ JMate]|accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;out-spoken&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;animaxis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animaxis.com/en/zine/newsletter/view.asp?id=N001249|title=Major Adult Film Company to Produce Children's Anime |publisher=[http://www.animaxis.com/en/ Animaxis.com]|accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; made SOD into one of the most creative, innovative and outrageous AV companies in Japan. One of his stunts involved using a crane to raise couples on a trasparent platform 20 meters into the air where they engaged in sex which climaxed in a bungee jump from the platform. Another large-scale production, ''All Naked Airborne F**k'', filmed from a helicopter, proved to be one of his rare failures with the public but Takahashi felt that the video &quot;showed our customers that we weren't afraid to spend the dough on making a good flick&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;xonge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;works&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;offbeat&quot;/&gt;

===Agriculture===
Takahashi retired from SOD at the end of fiscal year 2005 (March)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/sod/|title=高橋がなりブログ 虎の声 - SOD (Voice of the Tigers blog Takahashi - SOD)|publisher=[http://blog.livedoor.jp Livedoor Blogs]|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xonge&quot;/&gt; and used the 1 billion yen (about $10 million) &quot;[[golden handshake]]&quot; he received to purchase a farm in suburban Tokyo which would provide fresh produce to be served at his nearby restaurant. He traveled to farms all over Japan to learn the business and planned to bring his innovative style to farming as well - with a little pushing: &quot;Everybody who works for me is an idiot, who keeps saying how things can't be done instead of using their heads and trying to work out the ways things can be done&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryann|last=Connell|title=Japan's king of porn gets his hands dirty once again -- on the farm|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2007/02/20070226p2g00m0dm004000c.html|publisher=[[February 26]], [[2007]]|date= |accessdate=2007-03-06}} The original source is no longer available but a copy of the article can be accessed at http://www.amust4sex.com/adultnews/archives/2007/02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Takahashi started his new company &quot;National Farm&quot; (国立ファーム) in 2006 with the goal of trying to improve farm products saying that years of government subsidies had discouraged farmers - &quot;The farmers are not rewarded for producing better agricultural products&quot;. Takahashi's solution was to support new farming techniques and to encourage farmers by opening a series of restaurants buying fresh vegetable produce directly from farmers. A second restaurant was opened in the [[Roppongi]] district of Tokyo in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightnow.jp/article/51|title=百姓になった高橋がなりの『農家の台所』 (Takahashi and the farmer's kitchen)|publisher=[http://www.insightnow.jp/ Insight Now]|date=April 8, 2007|accessdate=2009-04-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightnow.jp/article/3055|title=高橋がなり・国立ファームの今後の事業戦略 (Business Strategy and the Future of Takahashi's National Farm)|publisher=[http://www.insightnow.jp/ Insight Now]|date=March 23, 2009|accessdate=2009-04-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iza.ne.jp/news/newsarticle/business/manufacturer/198790|title=農家直送の新鮮野菜提供　国立ファーム２号店オープン (National Farm Offering Vegetables Direct from Farm Store Opening 2)|publisher=[http://www.iza.ne.jp/news/ www.iza.ne.jp/news]|date=November 25, 2008|accessdate=2009-04-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other activities===
After leaving SOD, Takahashi did make one more foray into the AV business for the 2007 [[AV Open]] contest. His entry, ''Making AV Debut Without Being Nude'' (絶対にAVには出ません！というグラビアアイドルを「君なら裸にならないAV女優になれる」と口説いてAVに出てもらいました) [OPEN-0719] starring Mao Hirai, was made under the label of his first restaurant &quot;Kunitachi Farm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/avopen/avopen02.html|title=AV Open Entries|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|accessdate=2008-10-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video finished in 5th place in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/avopen/avopen02_result.html|title=2nd AV Open Results|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|accessdate=2008-10-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takahashi is married and has children.&lt;ref name=&quot;japaninc&quot;/&gt; When SOD  announced plans in 2004 to produce an adaptation of the [[Shougakukan]] [[Big Comic Original]] [[manga]] series &quot;Ajisai no Uta&quot; (Song of Hydrangea) as an [[original video animation]] (OAV), Takahashi said he started the project because he and his wife both enjoyed the manga and he wanted to make something his 6-year old son could enjoy.&lt;ref name=&quot;animaxis&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nihongo|'''Omorashi'''|オモラシ / おもらし / お漏らし}} is a [[fetish subculture]] recognized predominantly in [[Japan]], in which participants experience [[Sexual arousal|arousal]] from having a full [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] or a [[sexual attraction]] to someone else experiencing the feeling of a full [[bladder]]. Outside of Japan, it is not usually identified separately from [[urolagnia]] (urine fetish) though however they are different things. [[Western World|Westerners]] who do make the distinction commonly use phrases such as &quot;'''bladder desperation'''&quot; or &quot;'''panty wetting'''.&quot; The [[Japanese language]] term from which the subculture's name is derived means &quot;to wet oneself,&quot; literally translated, &quot;leaking.&quot; The word is also occasionally [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized]] as &quot;'''omorasi'''&quot; in the [[Kunrei-shiki]] romanization system.

==Attitudes toward sexuality in omorashi media==
Most fetish activities concerning the use of bodily waste are considered by the general public as &quot;[[hardcore pornography|hardcore]],&quot; [[taboo]], or [[edgeplay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthewhunt.com/website/taboo/bodilyfluids.html Taboo: Bodily Fluids [matthewhunt.com&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the object of the fetish is clothed incontinence, omorashi videos do not feature direct sexual contact. The focus on clothed rather than overtly sexual images makes [[garment fetishism]] a prominent feature in most omorashi erotica: commonly featured outfits include those worn by [[Schoolgirl uniform fetish|schoolgirls]], female [[suit and tie fetishism|working professionals]], and other women attempting to look dignified before succumbing to the need to wet themselves.

==Japanese subculture==
There are many ways in which omorashi fetishism is practiced in Japan.

===Yagai===
One of the variations is known as ''omorashi yagai'', which translates as &quot;to wet oneself outdoors (or publicly).&quot; A further variation includes ''yagai hōnyō'', or &quot;outdoor (or public) urination,&quot; in which the subject publicly removes their clothes to urinate. Other ''yagai hōnyō'' practitioners operate much like [[graffiti]] artists, attempting the public urination acts without being caught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellodamage.com/homedespot/Adictionary.htm HENTAI dictionary: japanese perversions, fetishes, and AV terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diapers===
Another variation of omorashi play is ''omutsu omorashi'', less commonly called ''oshime omorashi'', both of which translate as &quot;to wet oneself in a diaper.&quot; This omutsu variation is essentially the same as the standard omorashi, except that the participants are wearing a [[adult diaper|diaper]] instead of [[panties]]. Diapers may be favorable for public wetting because they render it more discreet and eliminate mess, and their use is not limited specifically to those with a [[diaper fetish]]. However, omorashi fetishists specifically interested in this aspect of the subculture could be considered a Japanese variation of the diaper lover community.

===Fetish media===
In addition to the numerous fantasy services though which omorashi fans can live out their desires, a wide variety of fetish media exist through which they can experience wetting scenarios. Though these of course include examples of full-blown pornography, the soft-core nature of omorashi lends itself just as easily to [[Japanese television drama|television dramas]], [[Ecchi#English usage|ecchi]] [[anime]], [[Japanese variety show|game shows]], and other more socially acceptable forms of entertainment. 

====Fetish Films====
{{Main|Pink film}}
In the years following the end of [[World War II]], eroticism had been gradually making its way into Japanese cinema. The first kiss to be seen in Japanese film– discreetly half-hidden by an umbrella– caused a national sensation in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|pages=602|chapter=18 (Naked Dissent)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, nudity in Japanese movie theaters, as in most of the world, had been a taboo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-22&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, with foreign films such as [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Summer with Monika]]'' (1953), [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[Les Amants]]'' (1958), and [[Russ Meyer]]'s ''[[The Immoral Mr. Teas]]'' (1959) introducing female nudity into international cinema, sexuality in films was being imported to Japan without problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-22&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, until the early 1960s, graphic depictions of nudity and sex in Japanese film could only be seen in single-reel &quot;stag films,&quot; made illegally by underground film producers such as those depicted in [[Shohei Imamura|Imamura]]'s film ''[[The Pornographers]]'' (1966).&lt;ref name=&quot;Erotic Nightmares&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/focus_takechi.shtml|first=Jasper|last=Sharp|title=Tetsuji Takechi: Erotic Nightmares|accessdate=2007-03-15|work=www.midnighteye.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during that period of the early sixties that the first wave of the ''Pink film'' began. Nudity and sex officially entered Japanese cinema with [[Satoru Kobayashi (director)|Satoru Kobayashi]]'s controversial and popular independent production ''[[Flesh Market]]'' (''Nikutai no Ichiba'', 1962), which is considered the first true ''pink film''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-21&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; Made for 8 million yen, Kobayashi's independent feature film took in over 100 million yen.

The popularity of Pink films continued to grow, and by the early 1970s, sex and sexuality had found their way into even the most mainstream Japanese films. So much so in fact, that many of the major studios would be forced to rely on such films to prevent the loss of their theatrical audience. With their access to higher production-values and talent, some of these films became critical and popular successes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domenig&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-02-19|last=Domenig|first=Roland|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avoid Japan's strict censorship laws, which limited depictions of actual sex and pubic hair, these movies often relied on fetish elements which could skirt such restrictions. One such film, ''[[Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom]]'' in 1973, would be the first to depict an omorashi scenario to a theatrical audience.  

As the [[chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] (adult video) genre took hold in the 1980s, videos specifically devoted to omorashi began to arise. Several notable [[AV idols]] have starred in such scenarios, including [[Sakura Sakurada]]. However, perhaps because of its softcore nature,  omorashi never became relegated to solely pornographic fare. 

[[Image:Giga omorashi.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Scenes from Giga's &quot;Desperation Tournament, volume 4.]]

====Game shows====
Today, Japanese omorashi fans also enjoy [[game shows]] in which contestants must compete in various urine-holding challenges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.kokoro-soft.com/dnanpa/pages/RVideos.html www.kokoro-soft.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Giga&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/sakuhinn_eng/category/category_omorashi.htm 無題ドキュメント&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; video company's &quot;[[Desperation Tournament]]&quot; series is an example of this kind of contest. One such activity has been a panel of contestants competing to hold their bladders or guess which woman has to use the restroom.

====Anime and manga====
{{Main|List of anime and manga featuring omorashi}}
Japanese produced omorashi media also include [[comic book]]s and [[animation]]. These range from independently produced [[dōjinshi]] to large commercially produced [[manga]]. Some focus exclusively on omorashi stories, while others include only the occasional scene. Some contain obvious sexual themes and could be considered a form of [[H manga]], while others, like ''[[Iinari! Aibure-shon]]'' are famous as all-ages comics, featuring only mild [[ecchi]] content such as [[panchira]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://zepy.momotato.com/2007/07/28/iinari-aibure-shon-toilet-paper/ Canned Dogs » Blog Archive » Iinari! Aibure-shon toilet paper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wetting scenes have existed in anime as early as the popular [[Devilman#The TV Series|''Devilman'']] of the 1970s. &lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed:  [[File:Nagisa 02.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A collectible figure based on Nagisa's omutsu omorashi scene in the eroge, ''MAID iN HEAVEN SuperS''.]] --&gt;However, these did not have the erotic context which characterizes modern omorashi media, since they predated the first full-blown anime pornography, which was not available until 1984, when the advent of the first [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVAs]] such as Wonder Kids' ''[[Lolita Anime]]'' were made possible by the widespread availability of [[home video]]. One example of this later erotic context is the 1994 [[H anime]] [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] ''[[Vixens]]'', which features scenes of incontinence in a setting that is overtly sexual. Over time, this sexual context became prevalent enough that it ceased limited to OVAs and was adopted into anime aired on [[network television]]. By the first decade of the [[21st century]], omorashi [[fanservice]] had become a common part of ecchi anime. In 2009, ''[[Fight Ippatsu! Jūden-chan!!]]'', which aired on the liberal [[AT-X (company)|AT-X]] network, would featured multiple omorashi situations in nearly every episode.

====Eroge====
An {{nihongo|''[[eroge]]''|エロゲー|erogē|'''ero'''tic '''ga'''me}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[Video game|video or computer game]] that features erotic content, usually in the form of [[anime]]-style artwork. The crossover of omorashi and anime fandom has produced a number of games such as ''[[Water Closet: The Forbidden Chamber]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animetric.com/bgames/water.html Animetric.com &gt;&gt; Bishoujo Game Reviews &gt;&gt; Water Closet: The Forbidden Chamber]&lt;/ref&gt; which are specifically focused on omorashi. The limited popularity of omorashi in the West has prompted a number of programmers in [[the scene]] to create [[software patches]] for these Japanese games which translate the on screen text into English.[http://shikkin128en.googlepages.com/]

Some eroge game designers have capitalized on omorashi fandom's [[niche market]] by including the occasional wetting scene in their games a selling point. ''[[MAID iN HEAVEN SuperS]]'',[http://doujinshi.mugimugi.org/book/556/MAID-iN-HEAVEN-SuperS/%E3%82%81%E3%81%84%E3%81%A9%E3%81%84%E3%82%93%E3%81%B8%E3%81%B6%E3%82%93%E3%81%99%E3%83%BC%E3%81%B1%E3%83%BC%E3%81%99] for example, which contains only a single, diapered wetting scene, was used to [[spin-off]] an entire set of collectible figures in various omorashi poses. [http://www.tisinc99.com/mai070604.html] These [[PVC]] [[Model figure#Otaku fandom|model figures]] were created by toy manufacturer Giga Pulse, which is not related to the video company of similar name. [[Image:Shizukuishi kyuun kyuun toilet paper.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A promotional image of collectible Shizukuishi kyuun kyuun toilet paper, with images from the all-ages omorashi comic, ''[[Iinari! Aibure-shon]].'']]

====Collectibles====
With the translation of omorashi into manga and its subsequent adoption by [[otaku]] [[fandom]], a number of omorashi themed collectibles have appeared on the Japanese market, including figurines&lt;ref&gt;[http://heiseidemocracy.com/2008/08/23/iinari-aibure-shon-gets-the-figure-treatment/ Iinari! Aibure-shon gets the figure treatment]&lt;/ref&gt; and
&quot;Shizukuishi kyuun kyuun toilet paper&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cospa.com/detail/id/0000020402 いいなり!あいぶれーしょん » いいなり!あいぶれーしょん » 雫石きゅんきゅんトイレットペーパ− | キャラクターグッズ＆アパレル販売のコスパ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; printed with wetting scenes featuring the character Shizukuishi from the omorashi manga, ''Iinari! Aibure-shon''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Outside of Japan==
Though there is a small community devoted to such fetishism outside of Japan, it is usually overshadowed by the more hardcore fetishes, urolagnia and urophagia. Outside of Japan, omorashi groups usually refer to their shared interest as &quot;desperation&quot; fetishism, often making a distinction between content featuring males and females. Some English language websites with a focus on females simply identify as &quot;panty wetting.&quot; Since such sites abandon the &quot;desperation&quot; title which implies an effort not to wet, they are more likely to include nudity, overtly sexual models and situations, as well as purposeful (as opposed to accidental) wetting.

Though the cultural [[memes]] of Western [[sexual ethics]] have not allowed such wide acceptance of incontinence-based play in many countries outside of Japan, recent studies in [[England]] have shown that urinary incontinence during sexual activity is a &quot;common, but rarely volunteered symptom&quot; observed in 24% of sexually active women. Moreover, no connection could be identified with any specific abnormality of bladder function associated with these symptoms, indicating that such leakage is both normal and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Khan |first=Z. |coauthors=Bhola A., Starer P. |title=Urinary incontinence during orgasm |journal=Urology |volume=31 |issue=3 |year=1988 |pages=279–282 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=3347980&amp;dopt=Citation |doi=10.1016/0090-4295(88)90160-4}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hilton |first=P. |title=Urinary incontinence during sexual intercourse: a common, but rarely volunteered, symptom |journal= British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=95 |pages=377–381 |year=1988 |accessdate=2007-04-20

[[Image:Wet Set Magazine, cover 26.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Wet Set magazine, an Australian wetting publication &quot;for 'accident prone' adults.&quot;]]

===Western publications and media===
Because of the western [[Social stigma|stigmas]] in numerous countries against wetting, omorashi subculture has not received such diverse exposure in non-Japanese media. In some countries, governments have even [[censorship|banned]] such materials. In [[New Zealand]] for example, creating, trading, distributing (e.g. making available on one's web page) anything containing &quot;the use of urine or excrement in association with degrading or
dehumanising conduct or sexual conduct&quot; is a felony punishable by up to ten (10) years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rangi.knowledge-basket.co.nz/gpacts/reprint/text/2005/se/042se3.html Text of the law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censorship.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Censorship-Compliance-Amendment-Act-2005?OpenDocument Description of ten year penalty]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Print====
One such example is the [[Australia]] based, internationally distributed, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wetset.net/Wet_Set_New_Magazine.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wet Set Magazine]]. The welcome header on their website reads:

{{cquote|Wet Set Magazine is for girls who enjoy the thrill of wetting their knickers, or peeing in their beds and diapers. Our girls are always desperate to go to the toilet, but love to pee in their pants instead! [http://www.wetset.net/]}}

Though Wet Set publications were originally only available in [[English language|English]], readership in [[German language|German]] speaking countries has since proved high enough to justify printing some materials in German.

Though Wet Set does not generally acknowledge the comparatively large Asian fan base over any other country, some Western proponents of omorashi recognize a heavy Asian influence. For instance, in a February 2006 issue of [[The Brooklyn Rail]], [[United States|American]] [[poet]] [[Garrett Caples]] of [[Oakland, California]] chose to describe the shooting of an omorashi [[film]] in a Japanese setting.[http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/archives/feb2006/FICTION/omorashi.html]

Aside from lending Western omorashi media an &quot;authentic&quot; quality, the inclusion of Japanese models and settings might also be seen as an attempt to play upon the [[stereotype]] of ultrapassivity globally associated&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoebe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Phoebe| last = Eng | year = 2000 | title = Warrior Lessons : An Asian American Woman's Journey into Power | chapter = She Takes Back Desire | pages = 115–142 | publisher = Atria | location = New York|isbn = 0671009575}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Asian women, further enhancing their perceived ''[[moe (slang)|moe]]'' qualities and catering to [[Asian fetish]]ists.

====Music====
[[Cat Chaser Conspiracy]], an [[United States|American]] [[All-female band|all-girl]] [[punk rock]] [[Musical ensemble#Rock and pop bands|band]], became known during the 80s and 90s for performing a panty-wetting stage act as they played songs about wetting themselves. Some &quot;wetty gurl&quot; fans would wet themselves when these songs were played.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/goth/catchaserconspiracy/ Cat Chaser Conspiracy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Before their breakup in 1999, members made regular appearances in the pages of Wet Set magazine. Their second [[vocalist]], Moppet, appeared as a model in a number of photosets, including #84 through 89.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wetset.net/photoset/Photoset_hod_84.htm] [http://www.wetset.net/photoset/Photoset_85.htm] [http://www.wetset.net/photoset/Photoset_86.htm] [http://www.wetset.net/photoset/Photoset_hod_87.htm] [http://www.wetset.net/photoset/Photoset_88.htm] [http://www.wetset.net/photoset/Photoset_89.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of omorashi in English language rock music include another all-female group, [[Crucified Barbara]], from [[Sweden]]. Their song &quot;I Wet Myself&quot; from their debut [[album]] ''In Distortion We Trust'' states:
{{cquote|Hey guys, I wet my pants
And it's fun, you should try it too

Oh yeah, I'm getting wet}}

Since their inception, the studio's original videos used production codes series of the type JUK-001 for VHS releases and JUKD-001 for DVD releases. Compilation videos were labeled in the series JUS-001 and JUSD-001. In December 2008, the original code was filled when video JUKD-999 was released. A new series of codes for DVDs was inaugurated in January 2009 in the format JUC-001. Compilation videos are still using the JUSD-xxx format.

[[Image:Harenchi Gakuen01.jpg|thumb|342px|Panchira scene from early seventies Japanese comedy, ''[[Harenchi Gakuen]]''. Skirt-flipping played a major role in both the manga and TV series.]]

{{nihongo|'''''Panchira'''''|パンチラ}} means [[upskirt]] in [[Japan]]. The word is a [[portmanteau]] of {{nihongo|&quot;[[panty]]&quot;|パンティー|pantī}} and ''chira'', the [[Japanese sound symbolism]] representing a glance or glimpse.

''Panchira'' is an expression used by Japanese women to warn each other that their underwear is visible; the term carries risque connotations similar to the phrase &quot;your [[Slip (clothing)|slip]] is showing&quot; in [[English language|English]] usage.

In [[anime]] and [[manga]], ''panchira'' refers to a panty-shot or upskirt take. It has been used extensively by Japanese artists and animators since the early sixties.

According to anecdotal sources in Japan, the convention is believed to have started with [[Osamu Tezuka]], whose character designs for [[Uran (manga character)|Uran]] (&quot;Astro Girl&quot; in English, from the ''[[Astro Boy]]'' comic strip (Japanese: ''Tetsuwan Atom'')) incorporated an improbably brief hemline. The practice was transferred to animation when ''Astro Boy'' was adapted for television in 1963. Confined mainly to harmless children's series throughout the remainder of the decade, panchira took on more fetishistic elements during the early seventies, most notably in Tezuka's ''[[Marvelous Melmo]]'' (1971), [[Toei Doga]]'s adaptions of [[Go Nagai]]'s ''[[Cutey Honey]]'' (1973), and Inoue Tomo's ''[[Majokko Megu-chan]]'' (1974). A more recent example is the notorious ''[[Agent Aika]]'' (1997–1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/agent-aika/vhs-1-lace-in-space |title=Agent Aika - Lace in Space |date=2009/08/21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From that point on, ''panchira'' was inextricably linked with the lewd humor that would, in time, become a staple of Japanese animation and entertainment in general (see [[Ecchi]] and [[Fan service]]). In the present day, ''panchira'' pervades almost every known anime genre, making it—arguably—one of the defining characteristics of the artform. It is particularly prevalent in so-called [[harem anime]], adult romances and [[hentai]].

==Indirect panchira==

In what can be viewed as a form of self-referential parody, some anime and related productions feature jokes centered around someone's reaction to off-screen panchira. Examples include:

* In the panchira-heavy anime ''[[Agent Aika]]'', a man avoids an all-female patrol by hiding under a grate in the floor. After they have walked overhead he emerges with a huge grin and steam coming out of his ears.
* In an episode of the anime ''[[Trigun]]'', a female hostage shoots her captor with a weapon held between her feet, since her hands are tied. The captor's last words are &quot;They were white.&quot;
* In ''[[Hayate the Combat Butler]]'', Miki sees Hinagiku changing, and reveals that her panties are orange with frills, and then continues by saying that they are rather cute and do not suit her, although Hinagiku says she likes them.

==Series with prominent panchira==
* ''[[AIKa R-16: Virgin Mission]]'', [[prequel]] to ''Agent Aika''
* ''[[Air Master]]''
* ''[[Blue Seed]]''
* ''[[Colorful]]''
* ''[[Iketeru Futari]]''
* ''[[Ikki Tousen]]''
* ''[[Kiddy Grade]]''
* ''[[Kirameki Project]]''
* ''[[Najica Blitz Tactics]]''

{{nihongo|'''Hadaka apron'''|裸エプロン|}}, from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word {{nihongo2|裸}} (''hadaka''), meaning nude, and the [[English language|English]] word [[apron]], is the word for a small niche [[clothing]] [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]. &quot;Hadaka apron&quot; is used to refer to an individual, typically a woman, wearing an apron over their otherwise nude or minimally clothed body.

The epitome of the &quot;teaser shot&quot;, hadaka apron is extremely popular on [[Japan]]ese [[CG artwork]] [[website]]s as a theme, especially for sites which attempt to titillate without being explicitly adult. &lt;!--It is also reported to be very popular in Japan amongst newlyweds as a form of [[foreplay]], and --&gt; It is also accepted as the [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] for newlyweds. It was the subject of several [[pin up]] images from the [[United States]] in the 1950s.

The popularity of this fetish originates from a segment of the late night Japanese [[television show]] ''[[Gilgamesh Night]]'', in which [[Pornography_in_Japan#Video|AV]] (&quot;adult video&quot;&amp;mdash;the Japanese term for direct-to-video pornography) actress Yuki Hitomi would cook while wearing only an apron.

Naked aprons are also featured on the 2003 series ''[[Barely Cooking]]'', seen on [[Citytv]]. It is a mostly standard [[cooking show]], with a male and female host demonstrating simple recipes while wearing large aprons that cover everything except the [[buttocks]]. This was also in the anime ''[[He is my Master]]'' twice: once in episode 3  and episode 6. 
Some reference is in ''[[Agga_Ruter]]'', episode 2.

[[File:Yep, shes glad she showered today (1420424100).jpg|thumb|right|An example of Nyotaimori]]
'''Nyotaimori''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 女体盛り, &quot;female body presentation&quot;), often referred to as &quot;body sushi,&quot; is the practice of eating [[sashimi]] or [[sushi]] from the body of a woman, typically naked. '''Nantaimori''' (Japanese: 男体盛り) refers to the same practice using a [[male model]]. This subdivision of [[food play]] is originally an obscure Japanese practice that has attracted considerable international media attention. As a result of being served on a human body, the temperature of the sushi or sashimi comes closer to body temperature. 

==Procedures ==
Before becoming a living sushi [[platter (dishware)|platter]], the person is trained to lie down for hours without moving. She or he must also be able to withstand the prolonged exposure to the cold [[food]]. [[Body hair]], including [[pubic hair]], would also be [[depilation|shaved]], as a display of pubic hair may be seen as a [[sexual act]].{{Fact|date=June 2009}} Before service, the individual would take a [[bathing|bath]] using a special fragrance-free [[soap]] and then finish off with a splash of cold [[water]] to cool the body down somewhat for the sushi. In some parts of the world, in order to comply with [[sanitation]] laws, there must be a layer of plastic or other material between the sushi and the body of the woman or man. Wrapping a naked person in [[cling film]] may also be regarded as [[mummification (BDSM)|a form]] of [[fetish model|fetishism]].

==Worldwide reception==
While legal in most jurisdictions, ''nyotaimori'' can cause some friction in more [[conservative]] societies. (''Nyotaimori'' is currently illegal in China. &lt;ref&gt;http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200505/23/eng20050523_186358.html &quot;The State Administration of Industry and Commerce issued a notice over the weekend banning meals served on naked bodies&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;) However, the practice of nyotaimori has swept through Europe, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/watercooler/naked.sushi.temple.2.884958.html Naked Sushi Night Coming To Minneapolis], Feb 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Popular culture==
Less common, but not unheard of, is the practice of using a [[male model]] for the same purpose, called nantaimori (Japanese: 男体盛り). Nyotaimori was parodied in the 2009 film [[Brüno (film)|Brüno]]. The title character serves sushi to [[Paula Abdul]] on the body of a naked [[Mexico|Mexican]] man, causing her to leave in disgust.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''{{nihongo|pink salon|ピンクサロン|pinkusaron}}''', or '''{{nihongo|pinsaro|ピンサロ|}}''' for short, is a type of [[brothel]] in [[Japan]] which specialises in [[oral sex]]. 

A pink salon is unusual in that the service is offered in small booths within a large open-plan room. The client is served [[soft drink]]s or [[alcoholic beverage]]s by the &quot;companion&quot; who performs [[fellatio]] on him. There may also be additional activities such as [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] the &quot;companion&quot; and [[sumata]].

Sumata is a form of [[Non-penetrative sex|frottage]], performed by a female [[sex worker]] upon a male client. The sex worker rubs the client's [[penis]] with her hands, thighs, and [[labia majora]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, Peter. ''Japan's Sex Trade: A Journey Through Japan's Erotic Subcultures''. Tokyo: Yenbooks, 1993, p. 75. ISBN 9784900737006.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to stimulate [[ejaculation]] without penile-vaginal [[sexual penetration|penetration]]. This activity circumvents the {{nihongo|Anti-Prostitution Law|売春防止法|Baishun Bōshi Hō}}&lt;ref name=wwwjdic/&gt; of 1956, which prohibits [[sexual intercourse]] for money.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] (Hōmushō), ''Materials Concerning Prostitution and Its Control in Japan''.

The rise in popularity is analogous to the growth in popularity of Western brothels and [[strip club]]s offering non-penetrative [[lap dancing]].

'''{{nihongo|Telekura|テレクラ|Terekura}}''', an [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words|abbreviation]] for {{nihongo|&quot;telephone clubs&quot;|テレフォン クラブ|terefon kurabu}}, are telephone-based dating services originating in [[Japan]].

In the original incarnation of the telephone club, popular in the mid-1990s, a male client would pay a fee to enter a booth with a phone.  The phone would then ring with calls from women willing to go on a date &amp;mdash; the implicit understanding being that this would lead to paid sex.  These clubs have been outlawed as fronts for [[prostitution]] in some jurisdictions in Japan.{{fact|date=February 2009}}

In modern telephone clubs, members pay a fee, after which they are supplied with the mobile phone numbers of women who sign up voluntarily to the sites. The caller then may arrange a meeting with a girl. Participants in the practice of ''[[enjo kōsai]]'' are thought to make use of this service.{{fact|date=February 2009}}

{{nihongo|'''Ushiro Takatekote'''|後ろ高手小手}} is the basic or foundational {{nihongo|[[Kinbaku]]|緊縛}}  form of binding the arms and breasts, in which the arms and hands are bound behind the back.  The term Ushiro Takatekote is made up of two Japanese words: (ushiro) 後ろ which means &quot;behind the back&quot; and  (tekatekote) 高手小手 which means &quot;bound hands and arms&quot;. This behind the back &quot;box arm tie&quot; as it is sometimes referred to in the west is based upon ties originally found in the samurai martial art of [[Hojōjutsu]] (捕縄術) or Nawajutsu (縄術), which later evolved into its erotic usage at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century. It is foundational to many other Kinbaku ties. 
The expression, Ushiro Takatekote is sometimes mistakenly and incorrectly referred to as &quot;[[Shinju]].&quot;

This position is easy to hold and allows a safe and very secure bondage. It is often used in complex ties where the subject is required to hold the position for a long time&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restrainedelegance.com/preview/lexicon1/icons/index.php Descirption on Restrained elegance, retrieved on Aug 26, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Image:ShudoMonogatari.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Shudō-type encounter between younger and older [[samurai]]. From &quot;Tale of Shudō&quot; (衆道物語) 1661.]]
{{nihongo|'''Shudō'''|衆道|shudō}} is the Japanese tradition of age-structured [[homosexuality]] or [[pederasty]] prevalent in [[samurai]] society from the [[medieval]] period until the end of the 19th century. The word is an abbreviation of ''wakashudō'' (若衆道), &quot;the way of the young&quot; or more precisely, &quot;the way of young (若 ''waka'') men (衆 ''shū'')&quot;. The &quot;[[Dō (Way)|dō]]&quot; (道) is related to the Chinese word [[tao]], considered to be a structured discipline and body of knowledge, as well as a path to awakening.

The older partner in the relationship was known as the ''nenja'' (念者), and the younger as the ''wakashū'' (若衆).

==Origins==
Though the term ''shudo'' first appears in 17th century, it is preceded in the Japanese homosexual tradition by the love relationships between bonzes and their acolytes, who were known as ''chigo''. The legendary supposed founder of male love in Japan is [[Kūkai]], also known as [[Kōbō Daishi]], the founder of the Shingon school of thought who is said to have brought over from the mainland, together with the teachings of the Shingon, the teachings of male love. &lt;ref&gt;井原西鶴, [[Ihara Saikaku]]. (Paul Gordon Schalow, trans.). The Great Mirror of Male Love. Stanford University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mount Kōya]], where Kōbō Daishi's monastery is still located, was a byword for male love up to the end of the pre-modern period.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

Despite the attribution of male love to Kūkai, references to male love can be found in some of the earliest Japanese texts, such as the 8th century history &quot;[[Kojiki]]&quot; (古事記) and the &quot;[[Nihon Shoki]]&quot; (日本書紀).

==Cultural aspects==
[[Image:Japanesepederasty18thcentury.jpg|left|thumb|250px|&lt;!--PLEASE SEE TALK PAGE SECTION &quot;Wrong caption for the Japanese illo&quot; BEFORE CHANGING THIS CAPTION, THANKS.--&gt;A youth entertains an older lover, covering his eyes while surreptitiously kissing a girl [[servant]].]]
The teachings of shudo, &quot;The Way of the Young&quot;, entered the literary tradition and can be found in such as works as [[Hagakure]] (葉隠), &quot;Hidden by Leaves&quot;, and other [[samurai]] manuals. Shudo, in its pedagogic, martial, and aristocratic aspects, is closely analogous to the ancient Greek tradition of [[pederasty]].

The practice was held in high esteem, and was encouraged, especially within the samurai class. It was considered beneficial for the youth, teaching him virtue, honesty and the appreciation of beauty. Its value was contrasted with the love of women, which was blamed for feminizing men.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

Much of the historical and fictional literature of the period praised the beauty and valor of boys faithful to shudo. The modern historian Jun'ichi Iwata drew up a list of 457 such titles from the 17th and 18th centuries alone, considered a &quot;corpus of erotic pedagogy.&quot;  (Watanabe &amp; Iwata, 1989)

With the rise in power and influence of the merchant class, aspects of the practice of shudo were adopted by the middle classes, and homoerotic expression in Japan began to be more closely associated with travelling [[kabuki]] actors known as [[tobiko (.)|tobiko]] ( 飛子) &lt;!--please disambiguate --&gt;, &quot;fly boys,&quot; who moonlighted as [[prostitute]]s.

In the Edo period (1600-1868), kabuki actors (known as [[onnagata]] when playing female roles) often worked as prostitutes off-stage. [[Kagema]] were male prostitutes who worked at specialist brothels called &quot;[[kagemajaya]]&quot; (陰間茶屋: kagema tea houses). Both kagema and kabuki actors were much sought after by the sophisticates of the day, who often practiced [[danshoku]]/[[nanshoku]], or male love.

Beginning with the [[Meiji restoration]] and the rise of Western influence, [[Christianity]] began to influence the culture, leading to a rapid decline of sanctioned homoerotic practices in the late 1800s.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{for|other uses of the term Shunga|Shunga (disambiguation)}}
'''{{nihongo|Shunga|春画|}}''' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for [[erotic art]]. Most shunga are a type of [[ukiyo-e]], usually executed in [[Woodcut|woodblock]] print format.  While rare, there are extant erotic painted handscrolls which predate the Ukiyo-e movement.&lt;ref name=Helsinki&gt;{{cite book | title=Forbidden Images - Erotic art from Japan's Edo Period |publisher=Helsinki City Art Museum |location=Helsinki, Finland |language=Finnish | date=2002 | pages=23–28|isbn=9-5189-6553-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translated literally, the Japanese word ''shunga'' means ''picture of spring''; &quot;spring&quot; is a common euphemism for sex.

[[Image:Katsushika Hokusai - Fukujuso.jpg|thumb|'''Two Lovers'''&lt;br&gt;[[Katsushika Hokusai]], ''The Adonis Plant (Fukujusô)'' [[Woodcut|Woodblock]] print, from a set of 12, ôban ca. 1815]]

The ukiyo-e movement as a whole sought to express an idealisation of contemporary urban life.  Following the aesthetics of everyday life, [[Edo period]] shunga sought to express the sexual mores of the [[chonin]] in the widest variety of forms possible, and therefore depicted [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]], old and young alike, as well as a wide range of [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]].  In the Edo period it was enjoyed by rich and poor, men and women, and despite being out of favour with the shogunate, carried very little stigma.  Almost all ukiyo-e artists made shunga at some point in their careers, and it did not detract from their prestige as artists.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;  Classifying shunga as a kind of [[medieval]] [[pornography]] can be misleading in this respect.&lt;ref name=Screech /&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Erotic netsuke-mammoth ivory.jpg|right|thumb|200px| Shunga [[Netsuke]] made from [[mammoth]] [[ivory]]]]

Shunga has its origins in [[China]].  It is thought that shunga were initially inspired by illustrations in [[China|Chinese]] medical manuals, a process which had its origins in the [[Muromachi]] era (1336 to 1573). [[Zhou Fang]], the great [[Tang Dynasty|T'ang Dynasty]] Chinese erotic painter, is thought to also have been influential. He, like many erotic artists of his time and place, tended to exaggerate the size of the genital organs, a common shunga topos.  While the literal meaning of the word, 'shunga,' is significant, it is in fact a contraction of, 'shunkyu-higa,' the Japanese name for Chinese sets of twelve scrolls depicting the twelve sexual acts that the [[crown prince]] had to carry out as an expression of yin-yang.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

In Japan, Shunga goes back to the [[Heian period]].  At this point it was the reserve of the [[courtier]] class.  Through the medium of narrative handscrolls, sexual scandals from the imperial court or the monasteries were depicted, and the characters tended to be limited to courtiers and [[monk]]s.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

The style reached its apex in the [[Edo period]] (1603 to 1867).  Thanks to [[woodblock printing]] techniques, the quantity and quality increased dramatically.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;  There were repeated governmental attempts to suppress shunga, the first of which was an edict  issued by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1661 banning, among other things, erotic books known as {{nihongo|''kōshokubon''|好色本}}.  While other genres covered by the edict, such as works criticising [[daimyo]] or [[samurai]], were driven underground by this edict, Shunga continued to be produced with little difficulty.  The 1722 edict was much more strict, banning the production of all new books unless the city commissioner gave permission, and after this edict Shunga went underground.  However, since for several decades following this edict [[publisher's guilds]] saw fit to send their members repeated reminders not to sell erotica, it seems probable that production and sale continued to flourish.&lt;ref name=Kornicki&gt;{{cite book | title=The Book in Japan: A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century | author=Kornicki, Peter F. |location=Honolulu | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | isbn=0-8248-2337-0| pages=331–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Meiji Period Shunga.jpg|right|thumb|150px| A man with a Western-style haircut makes love to a woman in traditional Japanese dress in this Meiji period Shunga print]]

The introduction of Western culture and technologies at the beginning of the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era (1868—1912), particularly the importation of photoreproduction techniques, had serious consequences for Shunga. For a time, [[woodblock printing]] continued to be used, but figures began to appear in prints wearing Western clothing and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;Majella Munro, Understanding Shunga, ER Books, 2008, p92, ISBN 978-1-904989-54-7&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Shunga could no longer compete with erotic photography, leading to its decline.

The art of shunga provided an inspiration for the [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] and [[Heisei]], or modern, period art known in the Western world as [[hentai]], and known (formally) in Japan as 'jū hachi kin' (literally, &quot;18-restricted&quot;, or adult-only) [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Like shunga, hentai is sexually explicit in its imagery.

== Production ==
Shunga were produced between the sixteenth century and the nineteenth century by ukiyo-e artists, since they sold more easily and at a higher price than their ordinary work. Shunga prints were produced and sold either as single sheets or&amp;mdash;more frequently&amp;mdash;in book form, called ''enpon''.  These customarily contained twelve images, a tradition with its roots in Chinese shunkyu higa.  Shunga was also produced in [[hand scroll]] format, called [[kakemono-e]] (掛け物絵). This format was also popular, though more expensive as the scrolls had to be individually painted.

The quality of shunga art varies, and few [[ukiyo-e]] painters remained aloof from the genre. Experienced artists found it to their advantage to concentrate on their production. This led to the appearance of ''shunga'' by first-rate artists. ''Ukiyo-e'' artists owed a stable livelihood to such customs, and producing a piece of ''shunga'' for a high-ranking client could bring them sufficient funds to live on for about six months.

Full-colour printing, or [[nishiki-e]], developed around 1765, but many ''shunga'' prints predate this.  Prior to this, colour was added to monochrome prints by hand, and from 1744 [[benizuri-e]] allowed the production of prints of limited colours.  Even after 1765 many shunga prints were produced using older methods. In some cases this was to keep the cost low, but in many cases this was a matter of taste.

Shunga produced in [[Edo]] tended to be more richly coloured than those produced in [[Kyoto]] and [[Osaka]], mainly owing to a difference in aesthetic taste between these regions&amp;mdash;Edo has a taste for novelty and luxury, while the [[kamigata]] region preferred a more muted, understated style.  This also translates into a greater amount of background detail in [[Edo]] Shunga.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

After 1722 most artists refrained from signing shunga works.  However, between 1761 and 1786 the implementation of printing regulations became more relaxed, and many artists took to concealing their name as a feature of the picture (such as calligraphy on a fan held by a courtesan) or allusions in the work itself (such as [[Utamaro]]'s enpon entitled, 'Utamakura.')&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

Edo period shunga sought to express a varied world of contemporary sexual possibilities.  Many writers on the subject refer to this as the creation of a 'pornotopia,' a world parallel to contemporary urban life, but idealised, eroticised and fantastical.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;&lt;ref name=Screech&gt;{{cite book | title=Sex and the Floating World | author=Screech, Timon | publisher=Reaktion Books | location=London | date=1999 | isbn=1-8618-9030-3 | pages=13–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Characters ===
By far the majority of shunga depict the sexual relations of the ordinary people, the ''chonin'', the townsmen, women, merchant class, artisans and farmers. Occasionally there also appear [[Netherlands|Dutch]] or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] foreigners.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

[[Courtesans]] also form the subject of many shunga.  [[Utamaro]] was particularly revered for his depictions of courtesans, which offered an unmatched level of sensitivity and psychological nuance.  Tokugawa courtesans could be described as the celebrities of their day, and Edo's pleasure district, [[Yoshiwara]], is often compared to Hollywood.&lt;ref name=BMP&gt;{{cite book | title=The Passionate Art of Kitagawa Utamaro |author=Shugo Asano &amp; Timothy Clark |publisher=Asahi Shinbunsha |location=Tokyo |isbn=978-0714114743 | date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Men saw them as highly eroticised due to their profession, but at the same time unattainable, since only the wealthiest, most cultured men would have any chance of sexual relations with one.  Women saw them as distant, glamorous idols, and the fashions for the whole of Japan were inspired by the fashions of the courtesan.  For these reasons the fetish of the courtesan appealed to many.&lt;ref name=Screech /&gt;

Works depicting courtesans have since been criticised for painting an idealised picture of life in the pleasure quarters.  It has been argued that they masked the situation of virtual slavery that sex workers lived under.&lt;ref name=Seigle&gt;{{cite book |last=Seigle |first=Cecilia Sagawa |title=Yoshiwara: The Glittering World of the Japanese Courtesan |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu |isbn=978-0824814885 | date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Utamaro is just one example of an artist who was sensitive to the inner life of the courtesan, for example, showing them wistfully dreaming of escape from Yoshiwara through marriage.&lt;ref name=BMP /&gt;

Similarly, [[kabuki]] actors are often depicted, many of whom worked as male gigolos.  These carried the same fetish of the sex worker, with the added quality of them often being quite young.  They are often shown with samurai.

===Stories===
[[Image:Dream of the fishermans wife hokusai.jpg|thumb|181px|''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', [[Hokusai]], c. 1820.]]
[[Image:Miyagawa_Isshô-Spring_Pastimes-F.jpg|thumb|'''Spring Pastimes'''&lt;br /&gt;
A tryst between a young man and a boy. See [[Nanshoku]]. &lt;br /&gt;[[Miyagawa Isshō]], ca. 1750; Shunga hand scroll (kakemono-e); sumi, color and gofun on silk. Private collection.]]

Both painted handscrolls and illustrated erotic books (enpon) often presented an unrelated sequence of sexual tableaux, rather than a structured narrative. A whole variety of possibilities are shown&amp;mdash;men seduce women, women seduce men; men and women cheat on each other; all ages from virginal teenagers to old married couples; even [[tentacle porn|octopi]] were occasionally featured.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

While most ''shunga'' were [[heterosexual]], many depicted [[homosexual|male-on-male]] trysts. [[Lesbian|Woman-on-woman]] was a rare feature but there are extant works depicting this. [[Masturbation]] was also depicted. The perception of sexuality differed, of course,  in Tokugawa Japan from that in the modern [[Western world]], and people were less likely to associate with one particular sexual preference. For this reason the many sexual pairings depicted were a matter of providing as much variety as possible.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

The backstory to shunga prints can be found in accompanying text or dialogue in the picture itself, and in props in the background. [[Symbolism]] also featured widely, such as the use of [[plum]] [[blossoms]] to represent virginity or tissues to symbolise impending [[ejaculation]].

=== Clothing ===

In almost all shunga the characters are fully clothed.  This is primarily because nudity was not inherently erotic in Tokugawa Japan - people were used to seeing the opposite sex naked in communal baths.  It also served an artistic purpose; it helped the reader identify courtesans and foreigners, the prints often contained symbolic meaning, and it drew attention to the parts of the body that were revealed, i.e., the genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Japanese Erotic Art and the Life of the Courtesan | author=Illing, Richard | publisher=Thames and Hudson | location=London | date=1978 | isbn=978-0500530238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of realism ===

Shunga couples are often shown in unrealistic positions with exaggerated genitalia.  Explanations for this include increased visibility of the sexually explicit content, artistic interest and psychological impact: that is, the genitalia is interpreted as a 'second face,' expressing the primal passions that the everyday face is obligated by [[Giri (Japanese)|giri]] to conceal, and is therefore the same size as the head and placed unnaturally close to it by the awkward position.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;

== Audience ==

Shunga was probably enjoyed by both men and women of all classes.  Superstitions and customs surrounding shunga suggest as much; in the same way that it was considered a lucky charm against death for a samurai to carry shunga, it was considered a protection against fire in [[merchant]] warehouses and the home.  From this we can deduce that samurai, chonin, and housewives all owned shunga.  All three of these groups would suffer separation from the opposite sex; the samurai lived in barracks for months at a time, and conjugal separation resulted from the [[sankin kotai]] system and the merchants' need to travel to obtain and sell goods.  It is therefore argued that this superstition was euphemistic in nature, and ownership of shunga was not superstitious, but libidinous in nature.&lt;ref name=Screech /&gt;

It was traditional to present a bride with shunga.  This and records of women obtaining it themselves from booklenders tells us that women were avid consumers of it.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;  Shunga may have served as sexual guidance for the sons and daughters of wealthy families. This has been disputed since the instructional nature of shunga is limited by the impossible positions and lack of description of technique, and there were sexual manuals in circulation that offered clearer guidance, including advice on hygiene.&lt;ref name=Screech /&gt;

Shunga varied greatly in quality and price.  Some of it was highly elaborate, commissioned by wealthy merchants and daimyo.  Some of it was limited in colour, widely circulated, and cost little more than a bowl of noodles.&lt;ref name=Helsinki /&gt;  Enpon were available through the lending libraries, or [[kashi-honya]], that travelled in rural areas.  This tells us that shunga reached all classes of society&amp;mdash;peasant, chonin, samurai and daimyo.

==Genre Classification==

There is dispute among scholars regarding how to classify shunga - though their sexually explicit nature leads one to consider them [[pornography]], there are serious problems with this assumption.  Specifically, it is difficult to separate shunga from ukiyo-e as a whole, in part because they were produced by the same artists designing non-explicit ukiyo-e.  [[Bijinga]], pictures of beauties (female and male) could be equally erotic, and there are many records of people [[masturbating]] over them, blurring the lines of the definition 'pornographic'.&lt;ref name=Screech /&gt;

[[Image:mokkori.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''[[Mokkori-kun]]'' is a T-shirt character from Japan based on a character used to promote mushrooms. Its unique shape is a sales point with T-shirt customers.]]

{{nihongo|'''Mokkori'''|モッコリ}} is a Japanese sound symbol word ([[gitaigo]]) that essentially represents the &quot;sound&quot; of something sticking out in a flat surface, or the sound of something rising very quickly. A popular term with fans of 80s [[Japanese animation]], it was popularized in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] [[City Hunter]] by [[Tsukasa Hojo]]. Ryo Saeba, the main character of City Hunter, took jobs to help people in need, always on the lookout for a &quot;mokkori chance&quot; (in the context of the series, a chance to do something perverted with a pretty woman). The term basically represents the sound or concept of a [[erection|penile erection]] rising.

The slang term [[schwing]] is a close English equivalent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Mizu shōbai''''' ({{lang-ja|水商売}}), or the '''water trade''', is the traditional euphemism for the night-time entertainment business in [[Japan]], provided by [[Hostess bar|hostess or snack bars]], [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s, and [[cabaret]]s. [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukichō]] in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]] is Japan's most famous area where one can patronize the water trade, as well as its more carnal counterpart {{nihongo|''Fūzoku''|風俗|}}—the sex industry composed of [[soapland]]s, [[pink salon]]s, [[fashion health|health]], and [[image club]]s. 

While the actual origin of the term ''mizu shōbai'' is debatable, it is likely the term came into use during the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] ([[1603]]–[[1868]])&lt;ref name=&quot;demente&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | url=http://www.davidappleyard.com/japan/jp23.htm
  | accessdate = 2006-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Tokugawa period saw the development of large [[bathhouse]]s and an expansive network of roadside inns offering hot baths and sexual release, as well as the expansion of geisha districts and [[courtesan]] quarters in cities and towns throughout the country.  Bearing relation to ''[[ukiyo]]'' (浮世 and 憂世), or &quot;the floating world&quot;, ''mizu shōbai'' is a [[metaphor]] for floating, drinking and impermanence{{Fact|date=October 2007}}.

According to one theory proposed by the ''Nihon Gogen Daijiten''&lt;ref&gt;前田富祺(編)『日本語源大辞典』(小学館)ISBN 4095011815。&lt;/ref&gt;, the term comes from the Japanese expression {{nihongo|&quot;Gain or loss is a matter of chance&quot;|勝負は水物だ|shōbu wa mizumono da}}, where literal meaning of the phrase &quot;matter of chance&quot;,  {{nihongo|''mizumono''|水物}}, is &quot;matter of water&quot;.  In the entertainment business, income depends on a large number of fickle factors like popularity among customers, the weather, the state of the economy, and success and failure change as rapidly as a flow of water. The ''Nihon Zokugo Daijiten''&lt;ref&gt;米川明彦(編)『日本俗語大辞典』(東京堂出版)ISBN 4490106386参照。&lt;/ref&gt;, on the other hand, notes that the term may derive from the expression {{nihongo|''doromizu kagyō''|泥水稼業}}, lit. &quot;muddy water earning business&quot;, for earning a living in the red-light districts, or from the Edo-era expression {{nihongo|''mizuchaya''|水茶屋}} for a public teahouse.

The creation of girls schools was very rapid at the time: by 1913 there were 213 such schools. The western novels ''[[Little Women]]'' and ''[[A Little Princess]]'' were translated into Japanese in 1906 and 1910 respectively, in order to educate the girls to become &quot;[[good wives, wise mothers]]&quot;. However, these works also introduced western concepts of sisterhood, sentimentalism, and romance to the girls of Japan. The tomboyish Jo of ''Little Women'' particularly gave Japanese girls a different idea of adolescence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flower Tales&quot;/&gt; In 1936, Class S stories were banned by the Japanese government.&lt;ref name =&quot;yaoi redrawing&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=McHarry|first=Mark|url= http://www.guidemag.com/temp/yaoi/a/mcharry_yaoi.html|title=Yaoi: Redrawing Male Love|journal=The Guide|date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[co-educational]] schools became more prominent, Class S relationships became more discreet.&lt;ref name=&quot;second coming&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''{{nihongo|Soapland|ソープランド|sōpurando}}''' is a type of [[brothel]] in [[Japan]] where male clients can engage in sexual activity with female [[prostitute]]s, although officially the clubs do business as places where the client is [[bathing|bathed]]. There are also a few soaplands specifically for female clients.&lt;ref&gt;Boye Lafayette De Mente, ''Sex and the Japanese: The Sensual Side of Japan'', (Rutland, Vermont: Tuttle Publishing, 2006), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are various kinds of soaplands, and they are usually located in complexes with varying numbers of soaplands. Well known complexes are located in [[Susukino]] in [[Sapporo]], [[Yoshiwara]] and [[Kabukicho]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanazuen]] in [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu]], [[Ogoto]] in [[Shiga]] and [[Fukuhara]] in [[Kobe]] but there are many other areas, especially in [[onsen]] towns. Prices for a session at a soapland vary depending on factors such as location, time of day, and length of session.

==Origins==

Soaplands began when explicit [[prostitution in Japan]] became illegal, as a simple form of bath where women washed men's bodies. They were originally known as ''toruko-buro'', meaning [[Turkish bath]]. Following a campaign by Turkish scholar Nusret Sancakli denouncing the use of this name for brothels,&lt;ref name=Constantine&gt;Peter Constantine, ''Japan's Sex Trade: A Journey Through Japan's Erotic Subcultures'', (Tokyo: Yenbooks, 1993), 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the new name &quot;soapland&quot; was the winning entry in a nationwide contest to rename them.&lt;ref name=Constantine /&gt;

'''{{nihongo|Kinbaku|緊縛|}}''' is the word for &quot;erotic bondage&quot; or '''{{nihongo|Kinbaku-bi|緊縛美|}}''' which literally means &quot;the beauty of tight bondage&quot;. Kinbaku (also Sokubaku) is a [[Japan]]ese style of [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] or [[BDSM]] which involves tying up the [[bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] using simple yet visually intricate patterns, usually with several pieces of thin [[rope]] usually hemp or jute (generally 6&amp;nbsp;mm or 8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter). 

The word Shibari came into common use in the West at some point in the 1990s to describe the bondage art Kinbaku. '''{{nihongo|Shibari|縛り|}}''' is a Japanese word that literally means &quot;to tie&quot; or &quot;to bind&quot;. It is used in Japan to describe the artful use of twine to tie objects or packages.

Japanese Bondage (kinbaku) is said to differ from Western bondage in that the [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] is almost always immobilized or restrained to gain pleasure from being under the pressure and strain of the ropes, often squeezing the breasts or genitals, while the Western practice of bondage often focuses more on the immobilization, or may be applied strictly for decorative purposes. Decorative bindings in japanese: &quot;nawakeshou&quot; (rope-make-up, litteraly).

The [[aesthetics]] of the bound person's position are also important: in particular, Japanese bondage is distinguished by its use of asymmetric and often intentionally uncomfortable positions, often giving choice of two 'evils' (two in different ways uncomfortable postitions to chose between by moving in the ropes), to heighten the psychological impact of the bondage. Western styles are usually more symmetrical and may sometimes only marginally restrict the bottom's ability to move.

Japanese bondage techniques use natural vegetable fiber rope ([[hemp]], [[jute]], or [[linen]]) exclusively. The natural fibers easily lock to each other making simple knots work very well. Traditionally multiple 7 meter lengths are used, though longer lengths may commonly be used for full-body or suspension work. [[Hojōjutsu]], the martial art employed by the Samurai, doesn't have to use any knots at all. Western styles may use traditional natural fiber (though often dyed for aesthetic color variation) or synthetic fiber ropes, which have become integrated over the years. Cotton was used early on, then nylon became popular in the 1980s or 1990s, followed by multi-filament [[polypropylene]] (MFP) ropes. The variety offers a choice of different textures and skin sensations, though knot choices become more complex because of the slippery nature of synthetic ropes. While both practices may use a few standard lengths of rope to fit different applications, Western full-body bondage tend to use longer lengths and often very complex decorative knots.

Kinbaku, with its roots firmly in Japan, and the more modern version shibari, have both gained popularity across the world. Kinbaku implies &quot;kokoro&quot;; heart, spirit, mind. And cannot be reached by skills of ropes/knots alone, but also requires ie transferring of ki-energy to take the model on the mental/spiritual ride.

==History==
[[Image:Img bird.jpg|thumb|Shibari art by [http://nawashi.com.ua/gallery nawashi Shadow]]] 
Although some of the techniques of Japanese sexual bondage originated with the military [[physical restraint|restraint]] technique of [[Hojojutsu]], sexual bondage techniques are far gentler, and great care is taken to avoid injury.

Many rope artists have derived their own flavor of Japanese-inspired bondage which often mixes some Shibari techniques with other forms of bondage.  Kinbaku is greatly influenced by the [[Sengoku period]] of Japan. One of Japan's darkest historical eras of torture and execution, it is still remembered for cruel means and methods that include the use of fire, knives, tattoos, boiling water, pheasants, divining blocks and rocking horses{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, etc. Eventually (in 1742) the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] government created a foundation of crime laws, which included the seven different types of punishment (Labour, [[slavery]], [[exile]], death, etc) and the four kinds of [[torture]] ([[whip]], [[pressing stone]], [[constriction]] by rope, and [[hanging]] by rope). 

According to several sources{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, bondage as a sexual activity first came to notice in Japan in the late [[Edo period]]. Generally recognized as &quot;father of Kinbaku&quot; is [[Ito Seiu]], who started studying and researching Hojojutsu in 1908 and turned it into an art form. Kinbaku became widely popular in the 1950s. In the 1960s, a tradition of bondage as a form of [[performance art]] developed in Japan.

In recent years Japanese style ropework has become popular in the Western [[BDSM]] scene.

==Technique==
Traditional Kinbaku is based on fairly specific rope patterns, most of them derived from Hojojutsu ties. Of particular importance are the [[Ushiro Takatekote]] (a type of arm [[box tie]]), which forms the basis of most Kinbaku ties, and the Ebi, or &quot;Shrimp&quot;, which was originally designed as a torture tie but today makes the bottom vulnerable for more pleasant forms of [[play (BDSM)|play]].

Generally, traditional Kinbaku is practiced with ropes of 7 meters (23&amp;nbsp;ft) in length. Due to the generally different physique of Western bottoms, 8 meter (26&amp;nbsp;ft) ropes are commonly used in the West. The rope material is usually [[hemp]] or [[jute]] (neither [[sisal]] nor [[manila hemp]] are usually useful), prepared according to specific techniques to achieve a pleasantly soft yet sturdy rope. Other materials are also sometimes used, although most synthetic ropes tend to be too slippery for Shibari techniques.

For historic reasons, Kinbaku uses very few knots, sometimes none at all, or only a [[cow hitch]] or an [[overhand knot]]. This requires rope with high friction. According to Sensei Nawa Yumio in his 1964 classic book on Torinawa, knots on a person was regarded as extremely disgraceful, something some would regard as worse than death. Restraints with no knots were not considered &quot;bondage&quot; and there was no shame in such; therefore, &quot;wrappings&quot; were used.

'''Futanari''' (二成, 二形; ふたなり; a [[compound word]] meaning &quot;two form&quot;) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] can mean both the subjects of a special type of [[pornography|pornographic]] [[anime]] or [[manga]] (commonly known in the [[Western Hemisphere|West]] as ''[[hentai]]''), or the genre itself. ''Futanari'' depicts [[hermaphrodite]]s, [[intersex]] or other individuals with female body-types and sexual organs resembling [[penis]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.animeph.com/voc.html#f | title = Anime Vocabulary / Terminology  | publisher = Animeph.com | accessdate = 2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common{{Whom?|date=August 2009}} terms used to describe ''futanari'' characters are &quot;dickgirls&quot; or &quot;[[shemale]]s&quot;, although these are often considered vulgar and incorrect.{{or|date=August 2009}} (The term &quot;shemale&quot; is typically used wrongly, since an accurate futanari character possesses a vagina.{{fact|date=August 2009}} [[Shemale]] is considered a separate genre by many futanari fans.{{By whom|date=August 2009}}{{Specify|date=August 2009}}) ''Futanari'', along with &quot;[[transsexualism|newhalf]]&quot;, are more polite terms having come into recent use, with ''futanari'' tending to refer specifically to actual hermaphrodites and &quot;newhalf&quot; tending to refer specifically to characters with female bodies but only male genitals.{{Fact|date=August 2009}}

Another way to describe futanari is &quot;Any hentai character that possesses both the traits of a female and the penis of a male.

==Description==
The term ''futanari'' is usually reserved for characters drawn in an [[anime]] art style. Female characters that share similar characteristics with ''futanari'' but are drawn in a Western style are usually simply referred to as &quot;dickgirls&quot;. {{Fact|date=April 2008}} 

&quot;Futas&quot;, as the female characters are often called, fall into several categories:{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

*The traditional form of ''futanari'' in which the female character is depicted as having both male and female sexual organs (the penis sprouting out above the clitoris and vagina).
*A variation on this form in which the penis takes the place of the clitoris. 
*A variation on the two above forms in which the testicles are omitted (i.e. the character will have a penis but no testicles).
*Enlarged or hypertrophic clitoris in which the character has no set of male sexual organs ''per se''. This is still arguably included under the blanket term ''futanari''.

It is almost always seen that a person who enjoys ''futanari'' prefers one form of ''futa'' over another, and this is usually only a matter of personal preference.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} The same can be said of ''futanari'' artists, who will most often use only one form of ''futa'' in their work.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

''Futanari'' characters can be (and often are) paired with various types of partners. Most often, the ''futa'' is paired with [[cisgender]] women.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} This is usually done in the same way other forms of [[hentai]] pair men and women. Variations on this theme include multiple ''futanari'' on one woman, ''futanari'' with other ''futanari'', and ''futanari'' on male (often done for a [[femdom]] fetish, although more ordinary male/female sexual interaction can be depicted as well).

It is interesting to note that, in some cases, the ''futanari'' character is depicted as having a penis and/or testicles that have grown to a size which is physically impossible.  This is somewhat similar to what is seen in some ''[[bakunyū]]'' characters, whose breasts are of a ridiculous size.

Another specific fetish involving ''futanari'' is the depiction of some object being inserted into the [[urethra]]. In many cases, this is an inanimate object, and the ''futa'' derives sexual pleasure from this in a way that is similar to when female characters in hentai insert an object into their [[vagina]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

However, a far less common variation includes two ''futanari'' characters, with urethral insertion by one ''futa'' insert her penis into the other's urethra. Then sexual intercourse occurs as though the penis of the first was in the vagina of the second.

In most types of hentai, there is some overlap between fetishes, and ''futanari'' is no exception. ''Futanari'' is often used with [[bukkake]], [[BDSM]], [[catgirl]], [[lolicon]] and [[tentacle sex]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

==Origins==
There are many theories as to why and how the theme of ''futanari'' came into being. The most obvious one is the close relationship that the ''futanari'' fetish shares with Western &quot;[[shemale]]&quot; pornography. However, due to the way it is executed, ''futanari'' probably shares more in common with the ''[[yuri (term)|yuri]]'' genre. ''Futanari'' can be seen as an extension of the [[lesbian]] theme where it is used instead of a [[strap-on dildo]] or equivalent. Except when it involves anything other than a ''futanari'' character and a [[cisgender]] woman.

Only a very small subset of ''futanari'' characters arise due to male to female transformation and most arise by other more outlandish means from normal females.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} This allows story lines to take a more lesbian context which is more palatable to [[straight]] males.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

''Futanari'' may also be seen as a way in which male empathy can be inserted into a predominately lesbian scene.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} Obviously one of the main difficulties that male observers have with lesbian scenes is that it is difficult to empathise or see oneself in the situation.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} In the ''futanari'' fetish, this becomes possible and this may appeal to a separate subset of people.

In normal anime, the [[gender bender]] or [[cross-dressing]] storylines have always been popular, for example in anime such as ''[[Ranma ½]]'' (in which the main character changes from male to female when he/she is splashed with water) and ''[[I My Me! Strawberry Eggs]]'' (which takes a more cross-dressing theme). Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the ''futanari'' hentai genre could well have sprung up from ''[[dōjinshi]]'' drawn about these series.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

==Definition and semantic drift==
===Etymology===
The word {{Nihongo|''yuri''|百合}} literally means &quot;[[Lilium|lily]]&quot;, and is a relatively common Japanese feminine name.&lt;ref name = &quot;alc-yurix&quot;/&gt; In 1976, Itō Bungaku, editor of {{nihongo|''[[Barazoku]]''|薔薇族||lit. rose tribe}}, a magazine geared primarily towards gay men, first used the term {{nihongo|''yurizoku''|百合族||lit. lily tribe}} in reference to female readers in the title of a column of letters called {{nihongo|''Yurizoku no heya''|百合族の部屋||lit. lily tribe's room}}.&lt;ref name =&quot;heya-1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=1976|month=November|title =Yurizoku no heya (lily tribe's room)|journal=[[Barazoku]] (Rose tribe)|pages=66–70|language=Japanese}}After this first column, Yurizoku no heya appeared sporadically through the mid-1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether this was the first instance of this usage of the term. Not all women whose letters appeared in this short-lived column were necessarily lesbians, but some were and gradually an association developed.

===Japanese vs. western usage===
As of 2009, the term ''yuri'' is used in Japan to mean the depiction of attraction between women (whether sexual or romantic, explicit or implied) in manga, anime, and related entertainment media, as well as the genre of stories primarily dealing with this content.&lt;ref name = &quot;about-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistswriters/a/EFriedman.htm |title=Interview: Erica Friedman (page 1) |accessdate=2008-05-17 |work=Manga |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;cyzo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyzo.com/2008/02/post_350.html |title=Joseidōshi no LOVE wo egaita, danshi kinsei no &quot;Yuri būmu&quot; gayattekuru!? |publisher=Cyzo |accessdate=2008-03-21 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[wasei-eigo]] construction {{Nihongo|&quot;Girls Love&quot;|ガールズラブ|gāruzu rabu}}, occasionally spelled &quot;Girl's Love&quot; or &quot;Girls' Love&quot;, or abbreviated as &quot;GL&quot;, is also used with this meaning.&lt;ref name = &quot;about-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hime-1x&quot;/&gt; ''Yuri'' is generally a form of [[fanspeak]] amongst fans, but its usage by authors and publishers has increased since 2005.&lt;ref name =&quot;cyzo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hime-1x&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morishima |first=Akiko |year=2008 |month=January |title=YurixYuri Kenbunroku |journal=[[Comic Yuri Hime]] |issue=11 |id=ASIN B00120LP56 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Girls Love&quot;, on the other hand, is primarily used by the publishers.&lt;ref name = &quot;about-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;gl-yuri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ichijinsha.co.jp/yurihime/ |title=''Comic Yuri Hime'' official website |publisher=[[Ichijinsha]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-01-19}} Ichijinsha classifies their yuri manga publication ''[[Comic Yuri Hime]]'' as a &quot;Girls Love&quot; comic magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

In North America, ''yuri'' has initially been used to denote only the most explicit end of the spectrum, deemed primarily as a variety of [[hentai]].&lt;ref name = &quot;whatisyuri&quot;/&gt; Following the pattern of ''[[shōnen-ai]]'', a term already in use in North America to describe content involving non-sexual relationships between men, western fans coined the term ''shōjo-ai'' to describe ''yuri'' without explicit sex.&lt;ref name = &quot;whatisyuri&quot;/&gt; In Japan the term {{Nihongo|''shōjo-ai''|少女愛||lit. girl love}} is not used with this meaning,&lt;ref name = &quot;whatisyuri&quot;/&gt; and instead tends to denote [[pedophilia]] (actual or perceived), with a similar meaning to the term ''[[lolicon]]'' (Lolita complex).&lt;ref name=&quot;gl-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Miyajima |first=Kagami |title=Shōjo-ai |date=[[April 4]] [[2005]] |publisher=Sakuhinsha |language=Japanese |isbn=4861820316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the western use of ''yuri'' has broadened in the 2000s, picking up connotations from the Japanese use.&lt;ref name = &quot;about-1&quot;/&gt; American publishing companies such as [[Yuricon|ALC Publishing]] and [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] have also adopted the Japanese usage of the term to classify their ''yuri'' manga publications.&lt;ref name = &quot;alc-yuri1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yuricon.org/alc.html |title=ALC Publishing |publisher=[[Yuricon]] |accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;seven-seas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/press_027.php |title=Yuri on the Seven Seas! |publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]] |accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yuri series==
These lists display stories according to the role ''yuri'' plays in them.

The second list contains stories in which the same subjects are used mostly for [[comic relief]], as [[fanservice]], or for [[characterization|character development]] in a larger, sometimes unrelated context.

{{wiktionary}}
{{nihongo|'''Bishōnen'''|[[wikt:美少年|美少年]]|extra=also [[transliteration|transliterated]] {{Audio|ja-bishonen.ogg|'''bishounen'''}}}}, is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term literally meaning &quot;beautiful youth (boy)&quot;.

The term describes an [[aesthetic]] that can be found in disparate areas in [[Asia]]: a young man whose [[beauty]] (and [[Sexual attraction|sexual]] appeal) transcends the boundary of [[gender]] or [[human sexual behaviour|sexual orientation]]. It has always shown the strongest manifestation in Japanese [[pop culture]], gaining in popularity due to the androgynous glam rock bands of the 1970s,&lt;ref name=Orbaugh&gt;{{cite book | last = Orbaugh | first =Sharalyn | editor = Sandra Buckley | title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | date = 2002 | location = | pages = 45–56 | isbn = 0415143446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has roots in ancient [[Japanese literature]], the [[homosocial]] and [[homoerotic]] ideals of the medieval [[China|Chinese]] [[noble court|imperial court]] and [[intellectual]]s, and [[India]]n aesthetic concepts carried over from [[Hinduism]], imported with [[Buddhism]] to [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encycle&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Buckley | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | date = 2002 | location = | pages = 188, 522, 553 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0415143446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, ''bishōnen'' are very popular among girls and women in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encycle&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=Caroline S.L.|date=2008|title=Of Senses and Men’s Cosmetics: Sensory Branding in Men’s Cosmetics in Japan|journal=European Journal of Social Sciences|volume=6|issue=1|pages=7–25|url=http://www.eurojournals.com/ejss_6_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for this [[social phenomenon]] may include the unique male and female [[social relationships]] found within the genre. Some have theorized that ''bishōnen'' provide a non-traditional outlet for gender relations. Moreover, it breaks down [[stereotype]]s surrounding [[Wiktionary:feminine|feminine]] male characters. These are often depicted with very strong [[martial arts]] abilities, [[sport]]s talent, high intelligence, or comedic flair, traits that are usually assigned to the hero/protagonist.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmsexuality&quot;&gt;Cartographies of Desire: Male-male Sexuality in Japanese Discourse, 1600-1950. Gregory M. Pflugfelder. University of California Press, 1999.ISBN 0520209095. Pg 221 - 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Kuniyoshi Ishiyakushi.jpg|right|thumb|Yoshitsune, a historical bishonen and his companion Benkei view the falling cherry blossoms.]]
The prefix ''bi'' ([[wikt:美|美]]) more often than not refers to [[Gender role|feminine]] beauty, and ''bijin'', literally &quot;beautiful person&quot;, is usually, though not always, used to refer to beautiful [[women]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encycle&quot; /&gt; ''Biseinen'' is to be distinguished from ''bishōnen'' as ''seinen'' is used to describe men who are of age, including those who have entered or completed tertiary education. The term ''shōnen'' is used to describe boys of middle and high school age. Last, ''bishota'' can be used to refer to a beautiful, [[pre-pubescent]] male child or a child-like male.&lt;ref name=&quot;encycle&quot; /&gt; Outside Japan, ''bishōnen'' is the most well-known of the three terms, and has become a generic term for all beautiful boys and young men.

The ''bishōnen'' is typically slender, with clear skin, stylish hair, and distinctly feminine facial features (such as high cheekbones), but simultaneously retains a male body. This [[Androgyny|androgynous]] appearance is akin to the depiction of [[angels]] in Western [[renaissance]] art, with similar social roots for this aesthetic.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmsexuality&quot; /&gt;

The aesthetic of the ''bishōnen'' was recorded in Lady [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[Tale of Genji]]'', written in about the year 1000 A.D. ''Genji'' concerns the exploits and romances of a young prince, the son of an emperor and beloved concubine, who is not in line to inherit the throne, and follows his intrigues through the court as he comes of age. The novel typifies the [[Heian period|Heian]] age of Japanese history, a period of highly-stylized romance. [[Hikaru Genji|Prince Genji's]] beauty is described as transcendental, so much so that &quot;one could have wished him a woman&quot;, with a bewitching attraction that is acknowledged by men and women alike.

[[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]] and [[Amakusa Shirō]] have been identified as historical ''bishōnen''.&lt;ref&gt;Drazen, Patrick (October 2002). '&quot;A Very Pure Thing&quot;: Gay and Pseudo-Gay Themes' in ''[[Anime Explosion! The What, Why &amp; Wow of Japanese Animation]]'' Berkeley, California: Stone Bridge Press pp.91-94. ISBN 1-880656-72-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ian Buruma notes that Yoshitsune was considered by contemporaries to be not physically prepossessing, but that his legend later grew and due to this, he became depicted with good looks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buruma|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Buruma|title=A Japanese Mirror: Heroes and Villains of Japanese Culture|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Great Britain|date=1985|origyear=1984|isbn=9780140074987|page=132-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyokutei Bakin]] wrote many works with [[nanshoku]] undertones featuring bishonen characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reichert|first=James Robert|title=In the Company of Men: Representations of Male-male Sexuality in Meiji Literature |publisher=Stanford University Press|date=2006|pages=3–4|isbn=9780804752145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1848 he used the term bishonen in the title of a work about the younger wakashu partner in the nanshoku relationship.&lt;ref name=Orbaugh/&gt;

The aesthetic of the ''bishōnen'' began as an ideal of a young [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] lover, likely arising from the effeminate male actors who played female characters in [[kabuki|kabuki theater]]. It is perpetuated today in [[anime]] and [[manga]], especially ''[[shōjo manga]]'' and anime, ''[[shōnen-ai]]'', and ''[[yaoi]]''.

==Usage==
Some non-Japanese, especially American, [[anime]] and [[manga]] fans use the term to refer to any handsome male character regardless of age, or any homosexual character.&lt;ref name=&quot;beauty&quot;&gt;Beauty Up: Exploring Contemporary Japanese Body Aesthetics. Laura Miller. University of California Press, 2006.ISBN 0520245091&lt;/ref&gt; In the original Japanese, however, ''bishōnen'' applies only to boys under 18. For those older, the word ''[[bidanshi]]'', literally &quot;handsome man&quot; is used. In the place of ''bishōnen'', some fans prefer to use the slightly more sexually neutral ''bishie'' (also spelled as ''bishi'') or ''bijin'', but these terms remain less common. The term ''binanshi'' was popular in the 1980s. ''Bishōnen'' is occasionally used to describe some androgynous female characters, such as Takarazuka actors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror p.125&quot;/&gt; [[Oscar François de Jarjayes|Lady Oscar]] in ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'',&lt;ref name=Orbaugh/&gt; or any women with traits [[stereotype|stereotypical]] to ''bishōnen''.

''Bishōnen'' is also used to describe an anime or [[manga]] character who is drawn as if a female, but has male components. This would make it easier for the artist to create a feminine male, rather than drawing a male character regularly.

Scottish pop singer [[Momus (artist)|Momus]] popularized the term with his song, &quot;Bishonen&quot; from the &quot;Tender Pervert&quot; album (released on Creation Records). Almost 8 minutes long, the song is an epic tale of a young boy raised to die young by an eccentric stepfather.

==Popular culture==
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:P car.jpg|230px|thumb|left|[[Yamashita Tomohisa]] of [[NEWS]]|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 22 December 2007}}]] --&gt;

The enduring preference for bishōnen males can clearly be seen in Japan and throughout parts of [[East Asia]] to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmsexuality&quot; /&gt;

In particular, Japan's largest male talent agency, [[Johnny &amp; Associates]] Entertainment Company specializes only in producing male [[tarento]] [[idols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-zone.com/modern/johnnys.shtml|title=www.japan-zone.com/modern/johnnys.shtml&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepted into Johnny &amp; Associates in their early teens, these boys, collectively known as 'Johnnys', are trained and promoted to become the next leading singing-acting-commercially successful hit sensations. Almost all can be classifed as bishōnen, exhibiting the same physically [[Femininity|feminine]] features combined with a sometimes deliberately [[ambivalent]] [[sexual orientation|sexuality]] or at the very least, a lack of any hint of a relationship in order to maintain their popular availability.

Current bishōnen examples from the same agency include [[Tomohisa Yamashita]] of [[News (band)|News]], [[Jin Akanishi]] and [[Kazuya Kamenashi]] of j-pop group [[KAT-TUN]] and [[Jun Matsumoto]] of [[Arashi]], all of whom are phenomenally successful throughout East Asia by appealing to both younger and older women and whose widely praised, gender-incongruous physical beauty is often deliberately manipulated in terms of [[role-playing]] and, most commonly, [[fanservice]].

==Art==
[[File:Bishounen Oranges.jpeg|thumb|Bishōnen Art]]
Besides being a character type, bishōnen is also a distinct art style not usually forgotten in books about drawing [[manga]]. In art, bishōnen are usually drawn delicately, with long limbs, silky or flowing hair, and slender eyes with long eyelashes that can sometimes extend beyond the face.

Bishōnen characters are fairly common in [[manga]] and [[anime]]; a heavy amount of male characters show subtle signs of the bishōnen style, such as slender eyes or a [[Femininity|feminine]] face.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmsexuality&quot; /&gt;

Some manga are completely drawn in the bishonen style, such as [[Dragon Knights]]. Bishōnen manga are more commonly [[shōnen-ai]] (focused on [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relationships), such as [[Boy Princess]].

==Bishōnen and Bishōjo==
Bishōnen can often be mistakenly categorized with [[bishōjo]]. Most people do not realize that there are major differences between the two.  

Bishōjo is more commonly centered around young girls, and drawn in a cute, pretty style; bishōnen is centered around teenage boys, and drawn elegantly. Another common mistake is that the female characters in bishōnen are bishōjo, arising from the fact that 'shōnen' means boy, and 'shōjo' means girl. In truth, the female characters of bishōnen manga are very different from those in bishōjo. Bishōjo females are usually smaller and drawn in a more cute than beautiful way, whereas bishōnen females exhibit the long limbs and elegance of bishōnen.&lt;ref name=&quot;beauty&quot; /&gt;

==Critical attention==
{{Expand-section|date=August 2008}}

Several cultural anthropologists and authors have raised the multifaceted aspect of what bishonen represents and what it is interpreted as, mostly to fit a particular external viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Montage, cinematic subjectivity and feminism in Ozaki Midori's Drifting in the World of the Seventh Sense. Livia Monnet.
ISSN: 0955-5803 1999, Vol 11 Issue 1 DOI: 10.1080/0955580990872162&lt;/ref&gt;  Ian Buruma noted that although Western comics for girls also included &quot;impossibly beautiful men&quot; who are clearly masculine and always get the girl in the end, the bishonen are &quot;more ambivalent&quot; and sometimes get each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror p.125&quot;/&gt;

For Sandra Buckley, ''bishōnen'' narratives champion “the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;&gt;Buckley, Sandra (1991) &quot;'Penguin in Bondage': A Graphic Tale of Japanese Comic Books&quot;, pp. 163-196, In ''Technoculture''. C. Penley and A. Ross, eds. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota ISBN 0-8166-1932-8&lt;/ref&gt;
James Welker describes the bishonen as being &quot;[[queer]]&quot;, as the bishonen is an androgynous [[aesthete]] with a feminine soul &quot;who lives and loves outside of the heteropatriarchal world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Welker |first=James |year=2006 |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=31 |issue=3 |doi= 10.1086/498987|title=Beautiful, Borrowed, and Bent: &quot;Boys' Love&quot; as Girls' Love in Shōjo Manga|accessdate=2007-11-20|pages=842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan D. Mackintosh believes that the bishonen is a &quot;traditional representation of youth&quot;, being &quot;interstitial&quot; between both childhood and adulthood and between being male and being female,&lt;ref&gt;http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue12/aoki.html&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of the sexual issues. 

Ishida Hitoshi makes the case that the image of the bishōnen is more about a grounding in sexuality than a transcendence of it, drawing on the idea of the image as being a refuge for alternative methods of looking at sexual natures, and sexual realities, at least since the 60's, rather than the elegiac aesthetics of usages in an earlier era.&lt;ref&gt;The Process of Divergence between 'Men who Love Men' and 'Feminised Men' in Postwar Japanese Media. Ishida Hitoshi and Murakami Takanori. Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context. Issue 12 January 2006. http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue12/ishida.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of men in manga by and for men show &quot;an idealized man being ultramasculine and phallic&quot;, bishonen are conversely drawn to &quot;emphasize their beauty and sensuality&quot;, and female artists have been said to react against the ultramasculine representation by showing androgynous and &quot;aesthetically beautiful&quot; men.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Andrea. (Spring 2006). &quot;Straight&quot; Women, Queer Texts: Boy-Love Manga and the Rise of a Global Counterpublic. ''[[WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly]]'', '''34''' (1/2), pp. 394-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Buruma, writing in 1984 considered the &quot;bishonen in distress&quot; to be a recurring motif in popular manga.  The bishonen in distress is always rescued by an older, protective, mentor.  This scenario has an &quot;unmistakably homoerotic&quot; atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror p.125&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Buruma|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Buruma|title=A Japanese Mirror: Heroes and Villains of Japanese Culture|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Great Britain|date=1985|origyear=1984|isbn=9780140074987|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also notes that bishonen must either grow up, or die beautifully.  He considers the &quot;worship&quot; of the bishonen to be the same as that of the [[cherry blossom|sakura]], and notes that &quot;death is the only pure and thus fitting end to the perfection of youth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buruma|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Buruma|title=A Japanese Mirror: Heroes and Villains of Japanese Culture|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Great Britain|date=1985|origyear=1984|isbn=9780140074987|page=130-131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar, [[South Korean]] aesthetic has been noted in the ''kkon-mi-nam''.&lt;ref&gt;http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/jung.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shotacon'''|ショタコン}}, sometimes shortened to {{nihongo|'''shota'''|ショタ|shota}}, is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[slang]] [[portmanteau]] of the phrase {{nihongo|''Shōtarō complex''|正太郎コンプレックス|Shōtarō konpurekkusu}} and describes an attraction to young boys, or an individual with such an attraction. Outside Japan, the term is less common and most often refers to a genre of manga and anime wherein pre-pubescent or pubescent male characters are depicted in a suggestive or erotic manner.{{#tag:ref|A cutoff of &quot;about 15&quot; has been suggested as the dividing line between shotacon and [[Yaoi#Usage|shounen-ai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandey|first=Ashish|title=Dictionary of Fiction|publisher=Gyan Books|date=2005|pages=234|isbn=8182052629|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} It can also apply to postpubescent adults with youthful [[neotenic]] features that would make them appear to be younger than they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Jason|title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]|publisher=Del Rey|date=2007|pages=501|isbn=0345485904}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is a reference to the young male character {{nihongo|Shōtarō|正太郎}} from ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''&lt;ref name =&quot;Otaku Sexuality p.236&quot; /&gt; (reworked in English as ''[[Gigantor]]''). The equivalent term for attraction to (or art pertaining to erotic portrayal of) young girls is [[lolicon]].

The usage of the term in both Western and Japanese fan cultures includes works ranging from [[Hentai|explicitly pornographic]] to mildly suggestive, romantic or entirely nosexual. As with lolicon, shotacon is related to the concepts of ''[[kawaii]]'' (cuteness) and ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' (in which characters are presented as young, cute or helpless in order to increase reader identification and inspire protective feelings). As such, shotacon themes and characters are used in a variety of non-erotic media. Elements of shotacon, like [[yaoi]], are comparatively common in [[shōjo manga]], such as the popular translated manga ''[[Loveless (manga)|Loveless]]'' (which features an eroticized but unconsummated relationship between the 12 year old male protagonist and his 20 year old male &quot;fighter unit&quot;), or the young-appearing character [[List_of_Ouran_High_School_Host_Club_characters#Mitsukuni_.22Honey.22_Haninozuka|Honey]] in ''[[Ouran High School Host Club]]''. [[Seinen]] manga, particularly  that aimed at [[otaku]], also occasionally presents eroticized adolescent males in a non-pornographic context, such as the cross-dressing 16 year old boy in ''[[Yubisaki Milk Tea]]'' or the [[homoerotic]] relationships between the [[Anthropomorphism|anthrophomorphic]] national personifications in ''[[Hetalia: Axis Powers]]''. 

Some critics claim that the shotacon genre contributes to actual [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse of children]],&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20040427zg.html|title=Does comic relief hurt kids?|author=Tony McNicol|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=2004-04-27|accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claim that there is no evidence for this,&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot; /&gt; or that there is evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond and Uchiyama&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_rape_jp.html|title=Pornography, Rape and Sex Crimes in Japan|author=[[Milton Diamond]] and Ayako Uchiyama|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–22|year=1999|accessdate=2008-01-06|doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(98)00035-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term &quot;shotacon&quot; is a [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words|Japanese portmanteau]] of {{nihongo|''Shōtarō complex''|正太郎コンプレックス|Shōtarō konpurekkusu}}, a reference to the young male character Shōtarō (正太郎) from ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''.&lt;ref name =&quot;Otaku Sexuality p.236&quot;&gt; Saitō Tamaki (2007) &quot;Otaku Sexuality&quot; in Christopher Bolton, Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr., and [[Takayuki Tatsumi]] ed., page 236 ''[http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/B/bolton_robot.html Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams]'' University of Minnesota Press ISBN 978-0-8166-4974-7 &lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series, Shōtarō is a bold, self-assertive detective who frequently outwits his adversaries and helps to solve cases. Throughout the series, Shōtarō develops close friends within the world. His [[bishounen]] [[cuteness]] embodied and formed the term &quot;shotacon&quot;, putting a name to an old sexual subculture.

Where the shotacon concept developed is hard to pinpoint, but some of its earliest roots are in readers responses to detective series written by [[Edogawa Rampo]]. In his works, a character named Yoshio Kobayashi of &quot;Shōnentanteidan&quot; (Junior Detective Group, similar to the Baker Street Irregulars of [[Sherlock Holmes]]) forms a deep dependency with adult protagonist [[Kogoro Akechi]]. Kobayashi, a beautiful teenager, constantly concerns himself with Kogoro's cases and well-being, and for a time [[cohabitation|moves in]] with the unmarried man. This nonsexual but intimate adult-boy relationship in part inspired the evolution of the shotacon community.

[[Tamaki Saitō]] describes the modern shotacon doujinshi community as having largely formed in the early 1980s and having a roughly even split between males and females.&lt;ref name =&quot;Otaku Sexuality p.236&quot;/&gt; Saitō suggests that shotacon was originally an offshoot of [[yaoi]], but when adopted by (straight) male readers became influenced by [[lolicon]]; thus, he claims &quot;''shota'' texts by female ''yaoi'' authors are structurally identical to ''yaoi'' texts, while ''shota'' by male ''otaku'' clearly position these little boys as young girls with penises.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Saitō Tamaki (2007) &quot;Otaku Sexuality&quot; in Christopher Bolton, Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr., and [[Takayuki Tatsumi]] ed., page 236-237 ''[http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/B/bolton_robot.html Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams]'' University of Minnesota Press ISBN 978-0-8166-4974-7 &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Shotacon publications==
Shotacon stories are commonly released in semi-monthly anthologies. Sometimes, however, mangaka will publish individual manga volumes. Many shotacon stories are published as [[doujinshi]]; {{nihongo|'''Shotaket'''|ショタケット}} {{#tag:ref|Also given in English as ''Shotaketto'', although it is officially romanized as ''Syotaket'' on the convention homepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/syotaket/index.html|title=Syotaket|date=not dated|publisher=Syotaket|language=Japanese|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}, an annual convention to sell shotacon doujin material, was founded in 1995,&lt;ref name=&quot;Syotaket_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/syotaket/history.html|title=History of Syotaket|date=not dated|publisher=Syotaket|language=Japanese|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently by a group of male creators.&lt;ref name =&quot;Otaku Sexuality p.236&quot;/&gt; The 2008 Shotaket had over 1000 attendees and offered work from nearly 200 circles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syotaket_history&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:June Almost Crying Mako Takahashi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Almost Crying'', by Mako Takahashi, a non-erotic [[Yaoi#Usage|shonen-ai]] shotacon manga.]]
Shotacon for women is almost exclusively [[yaoi]], and may be published in general yaoi anthology magazines or in one of the few exclusively shotacon yaoi anthologies, such as ''[[Shōnen Romance]]''. Because of the possible [[Legal status of cartoon pornography depicting minors|legal issues]], US publishers of yaoi have avoided material depicting notably underage characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pagliassotti BL West&quot;&gt;[[Dru Pagliassotti|Pagliassotti, Dru]] (November 2008) [http://www.participations.org/Volume%205/Issue%202/5_02_pagliassotti.htm 'Reading Boys' Love in the West'] Particip@tions Volume 5, Issue 2 Special Edition&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Digital Manga Publishing|Juné]] released an English translation of Mako Takahashi's {{nihongo|''Naichaisouyo''|泣いちゃいそうよ}} under the title &quot;Almost Crying&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junemanga.com/books/360/|title=Juné Manga - Almost Crying|publisher=Juné Manga|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-erotic shotacon manga; the book contains several stories featuring pubescent male characters, but their relationships are nonsexual.

Shotacon for male readers may feature heterosexual relationships (&quot;straight shota&quot;) or male-male relationships;{{#tag:ref|Male-male seijin shotacon is not properly considered [[yaoi]], and is published and marketed separately in Japan, but these genres are often conflated in Western terminology.|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} both are predominantly aimed at a presumptively [[heterosexual|straight]] male audience.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Shota stories may be published in (a subset of) general [[Hentai#Demographics|seijin]] (men's pornographic) manga anthologies or in the few seijin shota manga anthologies, such as ''[[Shōnen Ai no Bigaku]]'', which specializes in male-male stories. Some gay men's magazines which offer a particularly broad mix of pornographic material occasionally run stories or manga featuring peri-pubescent characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2006, the seijin shotacon [[OVA]] [[anime]] {{nihongo|''[[Boku no Pico]]''|ぼくのぴこ||lit. ''My Pico''|}}, which the producer has described as the first shotacon anime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Publications against shotacon==
In Japan a few works critical of shotacon exist as well. Most of them are not very popular or are not translated for release outside of Japan. One of the few comics in the western world that deals critically with the subjects of shotacon and abuse is the German manga-style comic ''[[Losing Neverland]]''.

{{nihongo|'''Hentai'''|変態 or へんたい|}} ''{{Audio|Hentai.ogg|listen}}'' is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word that, in the West, is used when referring to sexually explicit or [[pornography|pornographic]] comics and animation, particularly those of Japanese origin such as [[anime]], [[manga]] and [[Video game|computer games]] (see [[Japanese pornography]]). In Japan it can be used to mean &quot;[[metamorphosis]]&quot; or &quot;abnormality&quot;. The word &quot;''hentai''&quot; has a negative connotation to the Japanese and is commonly used to mean &quot;sexually [[Perversion|perverted]]&quot;.

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]] the word ''hentai'' is a [[kanji]] compound of 変 (''hen'' meaning &quot;change&quot; &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;strange&quot;) and 態 (''tai'' meaning &quot;attitude&quot; or &quot;appearance&quot;).  The term is used as a shortened form of the phrase 変態性欲 (hentai seiyoku), or &quot;sexual perversion&quot;. In slang, 変態 (hentai) is used as an insult meaning roughly &quot;pervert&quot; or &quot;weirdo&quot;. The term is not often applied to pornography in Japan.  Instead, terms such as ''18-kin'' (18禁, literally &quot;18-prohibited&quot;) meaning &quot;prohibited to those not yet 18 years old&quot;, and ''seijin manga'' (成人漫画 &quot;adult manga&quot;) are used when referring to pornography. The English letters AV are also used, standing for adult video.

== H, or ecchi ==

The English use of &quot;hentai&quot; is more similar to the way the Japanese use the slang term エッチ (''H'', or ''[[ecchi]]''), which refers to any sexually explicit content or behaviour. ''Ecchi'' is simply the spelling-out of the Japanese pronunciation of the letter ''H''.  The origins of this term are uncertain, but it may be a shortened form of ''hentai'' used as a polite codeword in the 1960s.

==Demographics==
As with other forms of Japanese pop-culture media, publishers of erotic media target material to specific demographic groups. For manga, the most typical divisions are:

====Types which are pornographic by definition====
[[Image:Dream of the fishermans wife hokusai.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'', a [[shunga]] woodcut made circa 1820 by [[Hokusai]].]]

*'''ero-manga''' or {{Nihongo|''seijin''|成人||literally &quot;adult&quot;}}, aimed at (presumptively heterosexual) men
*'''ladies' comics''' (''redīsu komikku'' or ''redicomi''), originally meaning any manga for adult women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gravett|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Gravett|title=[[Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics]]|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|date=2004|pages=116|isbn=1856693910}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[josei]]) but now often applied specifically to pornographic manga for women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shamoon|first=Deborah|title=Porn Studies|editor=[[Linda Williams (United States film critic)|Linda Williams]]|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2004|pages=77-103|chapter=Office Sluts and Rebel Flowers: The Pleasures of Japanese Pornographic Comics for Women|isbn=0822333120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types which often (but not necessarily) contain pornographic content====
*'''[[Bara (genre)|gei comi]]''' or ''menslove'' (ML), often called ''bara'' in the West, for gay men
*'''[[Yaoi|boys' love]]''' (''boizu rabu'' or BL), predominately aimed at the [[Shōjo manga|shōjo]] and [[Josei manga|josei]] markets (also see below)
*'''teen's love''' (TL), a more explicit type of [[Shōjo manga|shōjo]] [[Romance novel|romances]], likewise aimed predominantly at the [[Shōjo manga|shōjo]] and [[Josei manga|josei]] markets
*'''[[Yuri (genre)|Yuri]]''' or ''girls' love'' (GL), which has long been a component of both men's ''ero-manga'' and [[Shōjo manga|shōjo]] gender-exploration but has more recently arisen as a genre in its own right, in both ''seijin'' and [[Josei manga|josei]] flavors (also see below)

==Classification==
There are two main categories of hentai: works that feature mainly heterosexual interactions (often abbreviated as &quot;het&quot;),{{citation needed|date=October 2008}} and those that feature mainly [[homosexuality|homosexual]] interactions. This second group can be further split into [[yaoi]] and [[Yuri (term)|yuri]] subgroups. ''Yaoi'' refers to male homosexual pairings, and ''yuri'' to female homosexual pairings. (Note that both yaoi and, to a lesser extent, yuri are predominantly aimed at members of the opposite sex from the persons depicted.) 

Yaoi is predominantly aimed at a female audience and commonly features males of ambiguous [[gender]]—in both physical appearance and mannerism—called ''[[bishōnen]]'',  literally &quot;beautiful boy&quot;. Some feature ''biseinen'' (&quot;beautiful man&quot;), males of more adult or masculine appearance than ''bishōnen''. Less common are ''bara''—larger, often heavily muscled and sometimes hairy males, the yaoi counterpart of the &quot;[[Bear community|bear]]&quot; in [[gay pornography]]—as well as ''[[oyaji]]'' (meaning &quot;daddy&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot;), featuring middle-aged and elderly men; these types are mainly found in material aimed at gay men, which may be called ''[[Bara (genre)|bara]]'' or 'men's love' (ML), and is considered to be distinct from yaoi. Yaoi also extends beyond the (sexually explicit) hentai genre, since it is an applies to any anime/manga material that includes male homosexuality (except for that actually aimed at a gay male audience). In Western usage, yaoi is distinguished from [[shōnen-ai]] (literally, &quot;boy-love&quot;), in which two males merely express romantic feelings for each other without actually having sexual relations. Women interested in Yaoi are called &quot;[[Fujoshi]]&quot; (腐女子), a [[pun]] which translate loosely as &quot;rotten girl&quot;  or &quot;rotten woman&quot;. ''Compare [[fag hag]] and [[slash fiction|slash fandom]].''

Yuri is very similar to yaoi, except that the focus is on female homosexual interactions. The characters in yuri are typically &quot;[[bishōjo]]&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful girl&quot; (this term is not specific to yuri but is applied generally to depictions of attractive women for a male audience; for example, in the term &quot;[[bishōjo game]]&quot;). Shōjo-ai (&quot;girl love&quot;) is a western term for the female equivalent of shōnen-ai; in Japan these works are also called yuri. Yuri may be aimed at (presumptively heterosexual) male, [[heterosexual]] female, or [[lesbian]] female audiences.

The scope of hentai encompasses the entire range of sexual [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]], including:
*[[Bakunyū]], the depiction of women with large breasts. Literally translated to &quot;bursting breasts&quot;.
*[[Futanari]], depictions of [[hermaphrodites]] or [[transsexualism|transsexuals]] that have both phallic genitalia (penis with scrotum, only a penile shaft, or an enlarged clitoris) and vaginal genitalia, or, alternately, a feminine hourglass shape including breasts combined with a penis and scrotum.
*[[BDSM]], a spectrum of consensual sexual activities considered to be &quot;kinky&quot; or non mainstream, including such topics as power exchange (domination and submission), bondage, sadomasochism, spanking, etc.
*[[Bestiality]]
*Breast-oriented torture and [[Breast bondage]], BDSM practices focusing on breasts, many times coupled with a variety of [[torture]].
*[[Erotic lactation]]
*[[Lolicon]], depicts [[prepubescent]] or [[preadolescent]] girls.
*[[Pregnancy fetishism|Maiesiophilia]]
*{{nihongo|[[Omorashi]]|オモラシ / おもらし / お漏らし}} in which individuals struggle with a full bladder before finally wetting themselves (also known as [[Urolagnia|watersports]]).
*[[Urolagnia]]: Urinating
*[[Coprophilia]]: Feces
*[[Shotacon]], the depiction of young boys, either with other young boys or older men, or depicting young boys with older women (known as &quot;straight shota&quot; in western jargon).
*[[Tentacle erotica]], the depiction of tentacled creatures and sometimes monsters (fictional imaginative or otherwise, also includes alien-like creatures) engaging in sex or [[sexual assault|rape]] with girls and less often men.
*[[Incest]], sexual activity with legal family members; noticeably seen in ''[[The Sagara Family]]'', a hentai computer game.

==Hentai media==

*Adult anime, or [[List of hentai anime|hentai anime]], is anime that relies primarily on sex.
*Adult manga, or hentai manga, is manga designed for purely pornographic purposes. Plot is still used to develop character and setting, but most of the time, the ultimate goal is to show scenes of sexuality with few exceptions. Adult manga is often sold in convenience stores, book stores, and magazine stores in Japan, and also other public places such as airports, and is far more prolific and accessible than the U.S. adult [[comic book]] market. It is usually distributed in digest format, containing several stories by different artists (e.g. an [[anthology]]).
*Adult [[CG artwork]] includes individual drawings by artists. Art can be available on websites, [[CD-ROM]]s, or in printed art books. CG artwork is used frequently in adult video games.
*Adult video games, or [[eroge]], are games with a pornographic element. They can include [[bishōjo game]]s that involve character driven plots, and can exist as sex [[simulation]]s.
*Adult dōjinshi, or [[H dojinshi|H dōjinshi]], refers to a type of work that uses copyrighted characters presented in sexual situations. It usually refers to printed manga, but can also refer to any type of visual work depicting copyrighted characters, including video games, animation, and CG artwork. Familiarity with a particular character or setting can add a sense of relating to the character over a generic character used in mainstream hentai, making dōjinshi more appealing to fans of a particular work. Despite not representing characters and licensed properties as intended, companies often view these works as a free form of license recognition and advertising through dedicated fandom. Some mangaka create hentai dōjinshi with characters from their own manga, such as [[Kazushi Hagiwara]], who himself created ''Bastard - Expansion'', a pornographic dōjin with characters from ''[[Bastard!!]]''&lt;ref&gt;*[http://bangkok2005.anu.edu.au/papers/McLelland.pdf &quot;A Short History of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Hentai''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;], by Mark McLelland&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lemon===
In Western [[fanfiction]] circles, hentai-based works are popularly referred to as &quot;lemon&quot;, based on a more popular hentai anime anthology series called ''[[Cream Lemon]]''. Fictions referred to as &quot;lime&quot; are ones in which the characters do everything short of having sexual intercourse with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwsshe.murdoch.edu.au/intersections/issue12/mclelland.html &quot;A Short History of &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Hentai''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;], by Mark McLelland, ''Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context'', Issue 12, January 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{refimprove|date=September 2007}}
'''''Ecchi''''' (or '''''Etchi''''', from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] エッチ ''etchi'') is derived from a Japanese word meaning &quot;[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/letch letch]&quot;, &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;sexy&quot;, or &quot;lascivious&quot; when used as an adjective, or [[sexual intercourse]] when used as a noun.

==Japanese usage==
The origin of the term ecchi is uncertain. Ecchi in Japanese is attached to the Japanese pronunciation of the Roman letter &quot;H&quot; which is the first letter in the Japanese word &quot;[[Hentai]]&quot;, which may be [[backronym]].

The word sekkusu is also used in Japan for sex, and Japanese native words for sex (such as [[wikt:性交|性交]] ''seikō'') are often replaced by words of foreign origin such as sekkusu or neologisms such as ecchi. The nuance of ecchi varies with context, but in general the word itself is comparable to the English words &quot;naughty&quot; or &quot;dirty&quot; (when used as an adjective). The prefix &quot;H-&quot; is sometimes used to refer to pornographic genres: H-anime, H-manga, etc. It is the English-equivalent to &quot;X&quot; for &quot;X-rated&quot; or &quot;XXX&quot;.

==English usage==
[[Image:Anime Girl.svg|thumb|Drawing fitting some typical features]]
In English, the word is often used in the context of [[manga]] and [[anime]]. The term ''ecchi'' is applied to anime or manga that has vague sexual content (such as skimpy clothing, partial or full nudity), but does not show sexual intercourse, making it the manga equivalent of a PG-13 rated movie. ''Ecchi'' has historically often been used as a synonym of ''[[hentai]]'', presumably due to confusion of the two; thus it can carry different connotations than allowed for by the original Japanese. In recent years, however, its use by English-speakers has largely realigned with the Japanese meaning &amp;mdash; although H has become a completely separate term, inclusive of all of the above.

The ecchi art style is loosely comparable to [[pin-up girl]] artwork, as well as to provocative fantasy and [[comic book]] art in the [[United States]] and other countries.  Typical features include:
*Clothing that outlines the shape of the [[breasts]], nipples, and [[Labia (genitalia)|labia]], suggesting tightness of clothing and [[Sexual arousal|arousal]].
*Uniforms, costumes, or outfits (all tightly worn) that may be provocative, but are worn as everyday clothing by the character.
*Bouncing of over-size breasts(always pointing outwards as if an &quot;invisible bra&quot; was present.
*The common gag that is usually pulled off in anime, the &quot;head in breasts gag&quot; that is commonly used when a male meets a busty female and falls into her [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]. This can also be known as &quot;Marshmallow Hell&quot;.
*Characters who are unaware of their sexuality, appear innocent and cheerful, or sly and mischievous. 
*The [[groping]] of the breasts (whether intentional or not),which ends in either moaning of the girl or a slap on the gropee.
*Clothing that is falling off or being pulled off, notably swimsuits and [[Japanese school uniform|&quot;sailor&quot;-style schoolgirl uniforms]].
*[[Upskirt]] panty shots and [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]]. This is typically known as [[fan service]].
*Suggestive or [[phallic]] imagery.
*Exaggerated sexual attributes, often on normal or petite figures to give a sense of contrast. Especially used in [[dōjinshi]] and [[fanart]], where a character may appear more sexual than normal.
*The occasional bare breast(s)(rare) or bottom, but the genital area is rarely explicitly shown. (No vaginal slit)
*Skimpy bathing suits with [[crotch]] lines showing and sides of [[breasts]] showing.
*Shining skin indicating sweat or blurry and teary eyes.
*E.N.F. ([[Embarrassed nude female]]): A female character fully/almost nude in public showing signs of embarrassment, humiliation or acting completely normally.

[[Image:Yaoi Books.jpg|right|thumb|Books on display at a San Francisco bookstore.  Note that some titles are [[shrink wrap]]ped, indicating sexually explicit content.]]

{{Nihongo|'''''Yaoi'''''|やおい}}&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In careful Japanese enunciation, all three vowels are pronounced separately, for a three-[[mora (linguistics)|mora]] word, {{IPA-ja|ja.o.i|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a popular term for female-oriented fictional media that focus on [[homoerotic]] or [[affectional orientation|homoromantic]] male relationships, usually created by female authors.  Originally referring to a specific type of [[dōjinshi]] (self-published works) parody of mainstream anime and manga works, yaoi came to be used as a generic term for female-oriented [[manga]], [[anime]], [[BL games|dating sims]], novels and dōjinshi featuring idealized homosexual male relationships. The main characters in yaoi usually conform to the formula of the ''seme'' (literally: attacker) who pursues the ''uke'' (literally: receiver).

In Japan, the term has largely been replaced by the rubric {{nihongo|'''Boys' Love'''|ボーイズラブ|Bōizu Rabu}}, which subsumes both parodies and original works, and commercial as well as dōjinshi works. Although the genre is called Boys' Love (commonly abbreviated as &quot;'''BL'''&quot;), the males featured are pubescent or older. Works featuring prepubescent boys are labeled [[shotacon]], and seen as a distinct genre. Yaoi (as it continues to be known among English-speaking fans) has spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi is now available in many countries and languages.

Yaoi began in the dōjinshi markets of Japan in the late 1970s/early 1980s as an outgrowth of {{nihongo|'''shōnen-ai'''|少年愛}} (also known as &quot;Juné&quot; or &quot;tanbi&quot;), but whereas shōnen-ai (both commercial and dōjinshi) were original works, yaoi were parodies of popular &quot;straight&quot; [[shōnen manga|shōnen]] anime and manga, such as ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' and ''[[Saint Seiya]]''. 

BL creators and fans are careful to distinguish the genre from [[bara (genre)|bara]], including “gay manga,” which are created by and for gay men.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedagogy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Korean Fandom&quot;/&gt; However, some male manga creators have produced BL works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;&gt;Lunsing, Wim. [http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue12/lunsing.html Yaoi Ronsō: Discussing Depictions of Male Homosexuality in Japanese Girls' Comics, Gay Comics and Gay Pornography] ''Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context'' Issue 12, January 2006 Accessed 12 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yuri (genre)|Yuri]] is a wider blanket term than yaoi, because it refers to comics with lesbian relationships, regardless of the target audience, which may be (presumptively heterosexual) men, heterosexual women, or lesbian women. Yuri for actual lesbians tends to resemble the opposite of bara, while men's yuri manga is more like yaoi manga, since both are targeted at the opposite sex and are not about reflecting gay reality.

==Terminology==
===Usage===
Although different meanings are often ascribed to yaoi and boy's love, (with yaoi generally said to be more explicit and BL generally said to being less so) there is conflicting information on their usage.&lt;ref name = &quot;Yowie&quot;&gt;Masaki, Lyle.

Yaoi is an acronym created in the dōjinshi market of the late 1970s by [[Yasuko Sakata]] and [[Akiko Hatsu]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Otaku Sexuality Foreword&quot;/&gt; and popularized in the 1980s&lt;ref name=&quot;yaoi redrawing&quot;/&gt; standing for {{Nihongo|'''Ya'''ma nashi, '''o'''chi nashi, '''i'''mi nashi|ヤマなし、オチなし、意味なし|extra2=&quot;No climax, no point, no meaning&quot;}}.

Another term for yaoi is 801.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aoyama Eureka&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aoyama|first=Tomoko|date=April 2009|title=Eureka Discovers Culture Girls, Fujoshi, and BL: Essay Review of Three Issues of the Japanese Literary magazine, Yuriika (Eureka)|journal=Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific|volume=20|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/aoyama.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;801&quot; can be read as &quot;yaoi&quot; in the following form: the [[kun'yomi|&quot;short&quot; reading]] of the number 8 is &quot;ya&quot;, 0 can be read as &quot;o&quot; - a western influence without doubt, while the short reading for 1 is &quot;i&quot; (''see [[Japanese wordplay]]''). For example, an Internet manga called ''[[Tonari no 801-chan]]'', about an [[otaku]] guy who dates a ''fujoshi'', has been adapted into a serialized [[shōjo manga]] and a [[Live action|live-action film]]. 801-chan, the mascot of a Japanese shopping centre, is used in the manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-11-15/tonari-no-801-chan-fujoshi-manga-adapted-for-shojo-mag|title=Tonari no 801 chan Fujoshi Manga Adapted for Shōjo Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yaoi'' has become an [[umbrella term]] in the West for women's [[manga]] or Japanese-influenced comics with male-male relationships,&lt;ref name=&quot;aestheticism definitions&quot;/&gt; and it is the term preferentially used by American manga publishers.&lt;ref name = Boston/&gt; The actual name of the genre aimed toward women in Japan is called 'BL' or 'Boy's Love'. BL is aimed at the [[shōjo]] and [[josei]] demographics, but is considered a separate category.&lt;ref name=&quot;aestheticism definitions&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confused&quot;&gt;Thorn, Matt [http://www.matt-thorn.com/shoujo_manga/whatisandisnt.html What Shôjo Manga Are and Are Not - A Quick Guide for the Confused]&lt;/ref&gt; Yaoi is used in Japan to include dōjinshi and sex scenes,&lt;ref name=&quot;aestheticism definitions&quot;/&gt; and does not include [[Bara (genre)|gei comi]], which is by gay men and for gay men.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedagogy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aestheticism definitions&quot;/&gt;

The terms ''yaoi'' and ''shōnen-ai'' are sometimes used by western fans to differentiate between the contents of the genre. In this case, ''yaoi'' is used to describe titles that contain sex scenes and other sexually explicit themes and ''shōnen-ai'' is used to describe titles that focus more on romance and do not include explicit sexual content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drawn Together&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;What Girls Like?&quot;&gt;Cha, Kai-Ming (7 March 2005) [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA508674.html? Yaoi Manga: What Girls Like?] ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  When using the terms in this way, ''[[Gravitation (manga)|Gravitation]]'' is considered to be ''shōnen-ai'' due to its focus on the characters' careers rather than their love life, while the Gravitation Remix and Megamix [[doujinshi]] by the same author, which emphasize the characters' sexual relationships, would be considered ''yaoi''. Sometimes the word [[hentai]] is used as an additional modifier with yaoi - &quot;hentai yaoi&quot; - to denote the most explicit titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello Boys&quot;&gt;Thompson, David (8 September 2003) [http://www.newstatesman.com/200309080034 Hello boys] ''[[New Statesman]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Kaze to Ki no Uta]]''{{#tag:ref|First serialised in ''[[Shōjo Comic]]'' in January 1976, ''Kaze'' has been called &quot;the first commercially published boys' love story&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Toku Mechademia&quot;/&gt; but this claim has been challenged, as the first male-male kiss was in the 1970 ''In the Sunroom'', also by Keiko Takemiya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcj.com/journalista/?p=321 Journalista - the news weblog of The Comics Journal » Blog Archive » Mar. 27, 2007: The first draft of history (some revisions may be necessary)].Tcj.com.

Yaoi can be used by fans as a label for anime or manga-based [[slash fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Aquila, Meredith (2007) &quot;[http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/L/lunning_mechademia2.html Ranma 1/2 Fan Fiction Writers: New Narrative Themes or the Same Old Story?]&quot; ''[[Mechademia]] 2'' p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''shōnen-ai'' literally means ''boy's love'', the two terms are not synonymous. In Japan, shōnen-ai used to refer to a now obsolete subgenre of shōjo manga about prepubescent boys in relationships ranging from the platonic to the romantic and sexual. The term was originally used to describe [[ephebophilia]], and in scholarly contexts still is. Boy's Love, on the other hand, is used as a genre's name and refers to all titles regardless of sexual content or the ages of characters in the story (with the exception of titles featuring prepubescent boys, which are categorized as [[shotacon]], a distinct genre with only peripheral connections to BL).&lt;ref name=&quot;aestheticism definitions&quot;/&gt;

===Gei comi/Bara===
{{main|Bara (genre)}}
Although sometimes conflated with &quot;yaoi&quot; by Anglophone commentators, '''gei comi''' (also called &quot;Mens' Love&quot;, ML, in Japan and &quot;bara&quot; in English) caters to a gay male audience rather than a female one and tends to be made primarily by homosexual male artists such as [[Gengoroh Tagame]] and serialized in gay men's magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Seme and uke===

These terms originated in [[martial arts]] and do not carry any degrading connotations. ''[[Seme (martial arts)|Seme]]'' derives from the Japanese verb ''semeru'' (“to attack”) and ''[[Uke (martial arts)|uke]]'' from the Japanese verb ''ukeru'' (“to receive”). Though gay males are often referred to in English as &quot;[[Top (sex)|tops]]&quot; or &quot;[[Bottom (sex)|bottoms]],&quot; seme and uke are more nearly analogous to &quot;pitcher&quot; and &quot;catcher.&quot; The seme and uke are often drawn in the [[bishōnen]] style and are &quot;highly idealised&quot;,&lt;ref name = McLelland_2000/&gt; blending both [[masculinity|masculine]] and [[femininity|feminine]] qualities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella Otaku 1990s&quot;/&gt;

==Shōnen-ai==
{{nihongo|Shōnen-ai|少年愛|boy-love}} originally meant [[ephebophilia]] or [[pederasty]] in Japan, but from the early 1970s to the late 1980s, was used to describe a new genre of [[shōjo manga]], primarily by the [[Year 24 Group]], about beautiful boys in love. Characteristics of shōnen-ai include that they were exotic, often taking place in Europe,&lt;ref name=&quot;Welker06 842&quot;&gt;Welker, James. 2006. &quot;Beautiful, Borrowed, and Bent: 'Boys' Love' as Girls' Love in Shôjo Manga' ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' vol. 31, no. 3. page 842. {{doi|10.1086/498987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and idealistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzuki 250&quot;&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. &quot;Pornography or Therapy?

London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.251 ISBN 0847691365, ISBN 0847691373.&lt;/ref&gt; She says that this challenged the young readers and expanded their minds. Although they could not understand the works at first reading, as they grew older they would come to understand the works more. In the meantime, &quot;the readers' attention became focused on the figure of the male protagonist&quot; and how he navigated his sexual relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzuki 251&quot;/&gt; By the late 1980s, the popularity of professionally published shōnen-ai was declining, and yaoi dōjinshi was becoming more popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;out of hand&quot;/&gt;

==Dōjinshi==
The [[dōjinshi]] subculture has been considered the Japanese equivalent of the English-language [[slash fandom]], especially as they both do not have typical &quot;narrative structure&quot;, [[science fiction]] works are particularly popular in both,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella Otaku 1990s&quot;/&gt; and they both originated in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;yaoi redrawing&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drawn Together&quot;/&gt;
Typical yaoi [[dōjinshi]] features male-male pairings from non-romantic, published [[manga]] and [[anime]]. Much of the material derives from male-oriented [[shōnen]] and [[seinen]] works which contained male-male close friendships and are perceived by fans to imply homosexual attraction,&lt;ref name=&quot;out of hand&quot;/&gt; such as with ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;pedagogy&quot;/&gt; and ''[[Saint Seiya]]'', two titles which popularised yaoi in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;yaoi redrawing&quot;/&gt; ''Saint Seiya'' was particularly popular as it had a large cast of characters, most of them male, which allowed &quot;an incredible number&quot; of pairings between characters, although [[Andromeda Shun]] was one of the more popular characters to parody in yaoi, as he was presented in the original series as &quot;fragile and sensible, with fine traits, long hair, doe eyes and the most feminine armour of the group&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimbergt Saint Seiya&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Sébastien|last=Kimbergt|contribution=Ces mangas qui utilisent le yaoi pour doper leurs ventes|editor-last=Brient|editor-first=Hervé|title=Homosexualité et manga : le yaoi|publisher=Editions H|series=Manga: 10000 images|date=2008|isbn=978-2-9531781-0-4|pages=113-115|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, yaoi dōjinshi was known as “Captain Tsubasa”.&lt;ref name = &quot;unlikely explorers&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first= Matt |last=Thorn |authorlink=Matt Thorn | title=Unlikely Explorers: Alternative Narratives of Love, Sex, Gender, and Friendship in Japanese &quot;Girls'&quot; Comics | url=http://www.matt-thorn.com/shoujo_manga/sexual_ambiguity/index.html|accessdate=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dōjinshi has been described by [[Comiket]]'s co-founder [[Yoshihiro Yonezawa]] as being &quot;girls playing with dolls&quot;;&lt;ref name = revisited/&gt; yaoi fans may [[Shipping (fandom)|ship]] any male-male pairing, sometimes pairing off a favourite character, or creating a story about two men and fitting existing characters into the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedagogy&quot;/&gt;

Matt Thorn notes that unlike in slash fandom, a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] homoerotic element &quot;takes away the fun&quot; of creating yaoi for that series, for example, ''[[From Eroica With Love]]'' is more popular with slash fans than it has been with dōjinshi artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;out of hand&quot;/&gt; Kazuko Suzuki outlines the thematic development of the [[yaoi fandom]], from curiosity about sexuality, to taking a parodic revenge against men, to a feminist protest, and lastly, exploring &quot;ideal relationships&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. &quot;Pornography or Therapy?

London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.260 ISBN 0847691365, ISBN 0847691373.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important characteristics of the early yaoi dōjinshi were that they were amateur publications not controlled by media restrictions, the stories were by teens for other teens, they were based on famous characters who were in their teens or early twenties, the same age as the yaoi fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;yaoi redrawing&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=McHarry|first=Mark|url= http://www.guidemag.com/temp/yaoi/a/mcharry_yaoi.html|title=Yaoi: Redrawing Male Love|journal=The Guide|month=November | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1990s, dōjinshi played a part in popularising yaoi.&lt;ref name=McLelland_2000&gt;McLelland, Mark. &quot;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue3/mclelland2.html Male homosexuality and modern culture in modern Japan].&quot; ''Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context'' Issue 3, January 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Yaoi dōjinshi has been compared to the [[PWP (fanfiction)#PWP|Plot, what Plot?]] subgenre of [[fan fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark. (2006). &quot;Manga&quot; In Gaëtan Brulotte and John Phillips (eds.). ''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature''. New York: Routledge, pp. 849-851.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though collectors often focus on dōjinshi based on particular manga, any male character may become the subject of a yaoi dōjinshi, even characters from non-manga titles such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Granick, Jennifer (16 August 2006) [http://www.wired.com/politics/law/commentary/circuitcourt/2006/08/71597?currentPage=all Harry Potter Loves Malfoy] [[Wired.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Video games have also been parodied, including titles like ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aestheticism.com/visitors/gaming/kingdom_hearts/index.htm Kingdom Hearts] aestheticism.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vcj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/3/2/213|title=Heavy Hero or Digital Dummy? Multimodal Player–Avatar Relations in Final Fantasy 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most dōjinshi are created by [[amateurs]] who often work in &quot;circles&quot;{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}; for example, the group [[Clamp (manga artists)|CLAMP]] began as an amateur dōjinshi circle, drawing ''Saint Seiya'' yaoi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimbergt Saint Seiya&quot;/&gt; However, some professional artists, such as Kodaka Kazuma create dōjinshi as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Sharon (July 2006). [http://www.akibaangels.com/articles/07_2006/bebeautiful.php &quot;Be Beautiful: Yaoi Publishers Interviews Part 3&quot;]. ''Akiba Angels''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some publishing companies have used dōjinshi published in the 1980s to spot talented amateurs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Drawn Together&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bonking&quot;/&gt; such as Biblos hiring [[:ja:新田祐克|Yōka Nitta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yōka Nitta interview&quot;&gt;O’Connell, M.

Convention when labelling stories differs between Japanese fandom and slash-influenced fandoms. In Japan, the labelling is to put the two names of the characters separated by a [[multiplication sign]], with the [[seme]]'s name being first, and the [[uke]]'s being second.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagawa interview&quot;&gt;Toku, Masami (6 June 2002) [http://www.csuchico.edu/~mtoku/vc/interviews_full/Interview%20wi_%20Sagawa.html Interview with Mr. Sagawa]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest magazine about Boy's Love was ''[[June (manga magazine)|June]]'', which began in 1978 as a response to the success of commercially published manga such as the works of [[Keiko Takemiya]], [[Moto Hagio]] and [[Yumiko Ōshima]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagawa interview&quot;/&gt; Other factors was the rising popularity of depictions of ''bishōnen'' in the ''dōjinshi'' market and ambiguous musicians such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. ''June'' was meant to have an underground, &quot;cultish, guerilla-style&quot; feeling – most of its [[mangaka]] were new talent.  Frederik L. Schodt describes ''June'' as &quot;a kind of 'readers' magazine, created by and for the readers.&quot;  Essays about the characteristics of the June genre were published with the manga in ''June''.  In 1982, ''Shōsetsu June'' (&quot;Novel June&quot;), a sister magazine to ''June'' began publication.  Its content is text-only stories with male romance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreamland June&quot;/&gt; Nagaike believes that the true &quot;revolution&quot; in BL culture was when it began to be commercially published en masse in the 1990s.&lt;ref name =Nagaike&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nagaike|first=Kazumi|date=April 2009|title=Elegant Caucasians, Amorous Arabs, and Invisible Others: Signs and Images of Foreigners in Japanese BL Manga|journal=Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=[[Australian National University]]|issue=20|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/nagaike.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the mid-1990s, ''Shōsetsu June'' outsold ''June''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreamland June&quot;&gt;Schodt, Frederik L.

==Thematic elements==
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
BL has similar themes to heterosexual shōjo manga, several exploring adolescent romance and the &quot;interiority of the characters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamoon p.85&quot;&gt;Shamoon, Deborah (July 2004) “Office Sluts and Rebel Flowers: The Pleasures of Japanese Pornographic Comics for Women” in Linda Williams ed. ''Porn Studies''. Duke University Press p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Common characters in yaoi are schoolboys and [[yakuza]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequential Tart Translations&quot;&gt;Lee, Tammy (May 2001) [http://www.sequentialtart.com/archive/may02/johnson.shtml Tantalizing Translations - M.J. Johnson] ''Sequential Tart''&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, schoolboys are depicted in sexual situations, which is controversial when these titles are licensed in countries where underage sexuality and its depiction is taboo.&lt;ref name =Valenti/&gt;

===Female characters===
Female characters often have very minor roles in yaoi, or are absent altogether.&lt;ref name=Akibayaoi/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fletcher 2002&quot;/&gt; Suzuki notes that mothers, in particular, are portrayed badly, such as Takuto's mother from ''[[Zetsuai 1989]]'', who killed her husband in front of her young son. Suzuki suggests this is because the character and the reader are attempting to replace a mother's lacking &quot;unconditional love&quot; with the &quot;forbidden&quot; all-consuming love presented in yaoi.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. &quot;Pornography or Therapy?

''Sequential Tart''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early shōnen-ai and yaoi has been regarded as [[misogynistic]], but Lunsing detects a decrease in misogynistic comments from characters and regards the development of the [[yuri (genre)|''yuri'' genre]] as reflecting a reduction of internal misogyny.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt;  Alternately, the yaoi fandom is also viewed as a &quot;refuge&quot; from mainstream culture, which in this paradigm is viewed as inherently misogynistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;yaoi redrawing&quot;/&gt; [[Fumi Yoshinaga]] is regarded as a creator who usually includes at least one sympathetic female character in her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequentialtart.com/reports.php?ID=5222&amp;issue=2007-04-01|title=Ichigenme Volume 1|last=Mayerson|first=Ginger|date=1 April 2007|work=The Report Card|publisher=Sequential Tart|accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idealism===
Most BL manga have been said to &quot;foster an aesthetic of purity, even when depicting hard-core sex acts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamoon p.97&quot;&gt;Shamoon, Deborah (July 2004) “Office Sluts and Rebel Flowers: The Pleasures of Japanese Pornographic Comics for Women” in Linda Williams ed. ''Porn Studies''. Duke University Press p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Many BL manga have [[fantastic]], historic or futuristic settings, and many fans consider BL to be an &quot;escapist fantasy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shamoon p.86&quot;&gt;Shamoon, Deborah (July 2004) “Office Sluts and Rebel Flowers: The Pleasures of Japanese Pornographic Comics for Women” in [[Linda Williams (film critic)|Linda Williams]] ed.

The theme of the victory of the protagonists in yaoi has been compared favourably to Western [[fairy tale]]s, as the latter intends to enforce the [[status quo]], but yaoi is &quot;about desire&quot; and seeks &quot;to explore, not circumscribe, possibilities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi EEL&quot;&gt;McHarry, Mark. (2006) &quot;Yaoi&quot; in Gaëtan Brulotte and John Phillips (eds.). ''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature''. New York: Routledge, pp. 1445-1447.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hisako Miyoshi, vice editor-in-chief for [[Libre Publishing]], has said that she feels that boys love manga has become less realist, with more comedic elements or being &quot;simply for entertainment&quot;.  She thinks that earlier BL focused &quot;more on the homosexual way of life with a realist perspective.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hadrien |last=de Bats |contribution=Entretien avec Hisako Miyoshi|editor-last=Brient|editor-first=Hervé|title=Homosexualité et manga : le yaoi|publisher=Editions H|series=Manga: 10000 images|date=2008|isbn=978-2-9531781-0-4|pages=17-19|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape===
According to Suzuki, [[sexual intercourse]] in yaoi is a way of expressing commitment to a partner, and &quot;apparent violence&quot; in sex is a &quot;measure of passion&quot;. Suzuki elaborates that when a woman is raped, she is stigmatised by society, but in yaoi, boys who are loved by their rapists are still &quot;imbued with innocence&quot;, a theme she attributes to ''Kaze to Ki no Uta''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzuki 257-8&quot;&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. 1999. &quot;Pornography or Therapy?

London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, pp.257-258 ISBN 0847691365, ISBN 0847691373.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rape fantasy]] themes have been said to free the protagonist of responsibility in sex, leading to the [[Climax (narrative)|narrative climax]] of the story, where &quot;the protagonist takes responsibility for his own sexuality&quot;.&lt;ref name =Valenti&gt;Valenti, Kristy L. (2005). [http://www.tcj.com/269/e_yaoi.html &quot;'Stop, My Butt Hurts!' - The Yaoi Invasion&quot;]. ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', issue 269.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Tragedy===
June stories with suicide endings were popular,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreamland June&quot;/&gt; as was &quot;watching men suffer&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gravett&gt;[[Paul Gravett|Gravett, Paul]] (2004) ''[[Manga: 60 Years of Japanese Comics]]'' (Harper Design ISBN 1-85669-391-0) pages 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;  Matt Thorn theorises that depicting abuse in yaoi is a coping mechanism for some yaoi fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;out of hand&quot;/&gt; By the mid 1990s the fashion was for [[happy ending]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreamland June&quot;/&gt; When tragic endings are shown, the cause is not infidelity, but &quot;the cruel and intrusive demands of an uncompromising outside world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McLelland, Mark (2000) &quot;The love between 'beautiful boys' in women's comics&quot; page 69 ''Male Homosexuality in Modern Japan: Cultural Myths and Social Realities'' Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press ISBN 0700714251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical attention==
Boys' Love manga has received considerable critical attention, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside of Japan in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;out of hand&quot;/&gt; Different critics and commentators have had very different views of BL. In 1983, [[Frederik L. Schodt]] observed that “aesthetically” depicted male-male homosexual relationships had become popular among female readers as an extension of bisexual themes already present in shōjo manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schodt83&quot;&gt;Schodt, Frederik L. (1983) ''[[Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics]]''. pages 100-101 Tokyo and New York: Kodansha International. ISBN 0-87011-752-1&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese critics have seen BL as allowing girls to distance sex from their own bodies,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueno89&quot;&gt; Ueno, Chizuko (1989) &quot;Jendaaresu waarudo no &lt;ai&gt; no jikken&quot; (&quot;Experimenting with &lt;love&gt; in a Genderless World&quot;).

'' Bungei shunjū'', [[June (manga magazine)|June]], pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; In more elaborate theorizing, Kazuko Suzuki sees BL manga emerging from girls' contempt and dislike for masculine [[heterosexism]] and from an effort to define &quot;ideal relationships&quot; among men.&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, Kazuko. (1999) &quot;Pornography or Therapy? Japanese Girls Creating the Yaoi Phenomenon&quot;. In Sherrie Inness, ed., ''Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World''. London: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, p.246 ISBN 0847691365, ISBN 0847691373.&lt;/ref&gt; BL has been compared to [[romance novels]] by English-speaking librarians.&lt;ref name=yaoi101/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Romance by Any Other Name&quot;&gt;Brenner, Robyn [http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6477427.html Romance by Any Other Name]&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels have also been noted in the popularity of [[lesbianism in pornography]],&lt;ref name=bonking/&gt;&lt;ref name = revisited/&gt; and yaoi has been called a form of &quot;female [[sexual fetishism|fetishism]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visual Kei&quot;&gt;Hashimoto, Miyuki [http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2007v16n1/10%20Miyuki%20Hashimoto.pdf Visual Kei Otaku Identity—An Intercultural Analysis] Intercultural Communication Studies XVI: 1  2007 pp.87–99&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mariko Ōhara]], a science fiction writer, has said that she wrote yaoi [[Kirk/Spock]] fiction as a teen because she could not enjoy &quot;conventional pornography, which had been made for men&quot;, and that she had found a &quot;limitless freedom&quot; in yaoi, much like in [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;McCaffery, Larry; Gregory, Sinda; Kotani, Mari; Takayuki, Tatsumi (n.d.)

Other commentators have suggested that more radical gender-political issues underlie BL. Shihomi Sakakibara (1998) argued that yaoi fans, including herself, were homosexually oriented female-to-male transsexuals.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sakakibara&quot;&gt;Sakakibara, Shihomi (1998) ''Yaoi genron: yaoi kara mieta mono'' (An Elusive Theory of Yaoi: The view from Yaoi).

C. Penley and A. Ross, eds. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota ISBN 0-8166-1932-8&lt;/ref&gt; and James Welker described the ''bishōnen'' character as &quot;[[queer]]&quot;, observing that manga critic Akiko Mizoguchi saw ''shōnen-ai'' as playing a role in how she herself had become a lesbian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welker06&quot;&gt;Welker, James. 2006. &quot;Beautiful, Borrowed, and Bent: 'Boys' Love' as Girls' Love in Shôjo Manga' ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' vol. 31, no. 3. page 843. {{doi|10.1086/498987}} &lt;/ref&gt; Dru Pagliassotti sees this and the ''yaoi ronsō'' as indicating that for Japanese gay and lesbian readers, BL is not as far removed from reality as heterosexual female readers like to claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pagliassotti BL West&quot;/&gt; Welker added that ''shōnen-ai'' liberates readers &quot;not just from patriarchy, but from gender [[dualism]] and heteronormativity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welker06&quot;/&gt;

Some gay and lesbian commentators have criticized how gay identity is portrayed in BL, most notably in the ''yaoi ronsō'' or &quot;yaoi debate&quot; of 1992-1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mori Mari&quot;/&gt; In May 1992, gay activist Masaki Satō criticized yaoi fans and artists in an [[open letter]] to the feminist [[zine]] (or ''minikomi'' in Japanese) ''Choisir''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mori Mari&quot;/&gt; Satō said that yaoi failed to provide accurate information about gay men, promoted a destructive image of gay men as wealthy, handsome, and well-educated, ignored prejudice and discrimination against gay men in society, and co-opted gay men as masturbation fantasies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mori Mari&quot;/&gt; An extensive debate ensued, with yaoi fans and artists arguing that yaoi is entertainment for women, not education for gay men, and that yaoi characters are not meant to represent &quot;real gay men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mori Mari&quot;/&gt; As internet resources for gay men developed in the 1990s, the yaoi debate waned&lt;ref&gt;Blackarmor (February 19, 2008) &quot;A Follow-Up To the Yaoi Debate&quot; http://blackarmor.exblog.jp/7508722/ (In Japanese.)

''Sequential Tart''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 and 2004, [[Matt Thorn]] pointed to the complexity of these phenomena, and suggested that yaoi and [[slash fiction]] fans are discontented with “the standards of femininity to which they are expected to adhere and a [[social environment]] that does not validate or sympathize with that discontent.”&lt;ref name=&quot;out of hand&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Thorn1993&quot;&gt;Thorn, Matt.

As women have greater economic power, commercial demand for the sexualization of men may correlate. Korean manhwa writer Jin Seok Jeon wrote in a commentary to Vol. 5, Chp 2 of an Arabian Nights themed shonen-ai work, A Night of a Thousand Dreams, &quot;Men are now marketable. It's also a time where women are big consumers and can buy almost anything they desire. Some men think this is degrading...but the tables have turned, and I like the fact that men are just as commercialized now.&quot; He jokes that after researching guresh wrestling, which requires extreme physical fitness, he does not feel as marketable, illustrating that yaoi and other pornography exploiting men is subject to traditional criticisms, such as the objectification human beings to sexual caricatures and creating unrealistic expectations and negative body images. For the same reasons, it may be celebrated for evening the field between genders and opening a fuller debate on personhood and sexuality.{{Citation-needed|date=August 2008}}

In China, BL became very popular in the late 1990s, attracting media attention, which became negative, focusing on the challenge it posed to &quot;heterosexual hegemony&quot;. Publishing and distributing BL is illegal in mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/liu.htm |title=Intersections: Conflicting Discourses on Boys’ Love and Subcultural Tactics in Mainland China and Hong Kong |publisher=Intersections.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 a moral panic erupted in [[Thailand]] regarding homosexual male comics. Television reports labeled the comics as negative influences, while a newspaper falsely stated that most of the comics were not copyrighted as the publishers feared arrest for posting the content; in reality most of the titles were likely illegally published without permission from the original Japanese publishers. The ''shōnen ai'' comics provided profits for the comic shops, which sold between 30 to 50 such comics per day. The moral panic regarding the male homosexual comics subsided. The Thai girls felt too embarrassed to read heterosexual stories, so they read homosexual male-themed josei and shojo stories, which they saw as &quot;unthreatening.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. ''The Essential Guide to World Comics''. ''[[Collins &amp; Brown]]''. 2005. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in Japan, concern about manga has been mostly directed to [[shonen manga]], in 2006, an email campaign was launched against the availability of BL manga in [[Sakai City]]'s public library.  In August 2008, the library decided to stop buying more BL, and to keep its existing BL in a collection restricted to adult readers.  That November, the library was contacted by people who protested against the removal, regarding it as &quot;a form of sexual discrimination&quot;.  The Japanese media ran stories on how much BL was in public libraries, and emphasised that this sexual material had been loaned out to minors.  Debate ensued on [[Mixi]], a Japanese social networking site, and eventually the library returned its BL to the public collection.  Mark McLelland suggests that BL may become &quot;a major battlefront for proponents and detractors of '[[gender equality|gender free]]' policies in employment, education and elsewhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue20/mclelland.htm |title=Intersections: (A)cute Confusion: The Unpredictable Journey of Japanese Popular Culture |publisher=Intersections.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nihongo|'''Enjo-kōsai'''|[[:ja:援助交際|援助交際]]}} (shortened form 
{{nihongo|'''enkō'''|援交}}) means &quot;compensated [[dating]]&quot; and is a practice which originated in [[Japan]] where older men give money and/or luxury gifts to attractive women for their companionship, and possibly sexual favors. The female participants range from [[schoolgirl|school-age girls]] to [[housewives]]. A common misconception is that enjo-kōsai always involves some form of sexual activity. The term enjo-kōsai first appeared in the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' on September 20, 1994. In the opposite case of women paying men, it is called {{nihongo|'''gyaku-enjo-kōsai'''|逆援助交際}}, or &quot;wakari.&quot; {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Definition==
What constitutes enjo-kōsai is heavily contested within Japan. The most common connotation is that it is a form of [[child prostitution]] whereby participating girls sell their bodies in exchange for designer goods or money. However, to label enjo-kōsai by the most basic definition of [[prostitution]] whereby one attains money through the exchange of sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/prostitution prostitution]&quot; Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law. Merriam-Webster, Inc. 01 Oct. 2007. &lt;Dictionary.com&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; excludes an array of other activities.
 
Many groups, including women's centers and associations within Japan include “the exchange of a girl's company or time” as part of this equation&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.dawncenter.or.jp/english/publication/edawn/9911/mean.html The Meaning of Enjo-Kousai]&quot; DawnCenter Official Web Site. 2003. Dawn Center- Osaka Women's Prefectural Center. 12 October 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; and insist that these other activities define enjo-kōsai. [[Anthropologist]] Laura Miller argues  in her research that the majority of enjo-kōsai  dates consists of groups of girls going with a group of older men to a [[karaoke bar]] for several hours and being paid for their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Furthermore, in a 1998 survey by the Asian Women's Fund, researchers found that fewer than 10 percent of all high school girls engage in enjo-kōsai and over 90 percent of the girls interviewed attested to feeling uncomfortable with the exchange or purchase of sexual services for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Perceptions in Japanese society==
Generally in Japan, enjo-kōsai is looked down upon as a large-scale social problem. A 1997 poll in the Japanese [[TV Asahi]] program ''Asa Made Nama Terebi'' showed that 70 percent of respondents opposed enjo-kōsai, while 30 percent approved of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;Leheny, David. Think Global, Fear Local: Sex, Violence and Anxiety in Contemporary Japan. New York: Cornell University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, it is perceived as an extension of Japan's growing focus on [[consumerism|materialism]], much of which is what critics claim is the cause of enjo-kōsai. Critics worry that girls involved in enjo-kōsai will grow up to be unfit wives and mothers. This perception arises from suspicions that when these girls are adults, they will quickly abandon their loyalties and commitments to their family for offers of money and material benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot; /&gt; However, certain [[feminist]] groups and critics find enjo-kōsai to be empowering and as an act to “undermine patriarchal models propriety used to evaluate and control women”. Control over their bodies and means to support themselves is a new kind of independence for these girls. Good women in Japan are supposed to be sensible, modest, nurturing and respectful, yet girls participating in enjo-kōsai clearly reject such virtues of female restraint and modesty in Japan. Feminists such as Chizuko Ueno point out that the accidental access of girls to this dating market was not a matter of ethics, but of probability.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot; /&gt; Sooner or later, these girls and young women would, in a desire for financial independence, tap into this market for their own empowerment.

==Media depiction==
Within Japan, the media tends to show enjo-kōsai in a rather negative light. The typical scenario involves a girl desperate for money, so she decides to partake in enjo-kōsai. Only later does she stop when a friend or individual intervenes and informs her of the potential risks and consequences of her behavior.  Several examples from films and television series are listed below.

In [[Hideaki Anno]]’s 1998 movie ''[[Love &amp; Pop]]'', the main character, a 16-year-old high school girl named Hiromi, goes on subsidized dates in order to purchase a ring she adores. Her parents do not pay much attention to her and Hiromi often hangs out with her three closest friends who have been going on subsidized dates. Feeling like a train that travels on a predetermined track, Hiromi follows her friends and begins doing the same. Throughout the movie, they meet with different kinds of men and accompany them in various activities. These activities include having dinner at a restaurant, tasting a man’s cooking, singing at a karaoke bar, shopping in a video rental store, etc. Although Hiromi nearly gives in and has sex for the remainder of money needed for the ring, her date gives her a lesson on why she shouldn’t give up her body.

Meanwhile, the Japanese live action drama series ''[[Great Teacher Onizuka|GTO]]'' (''Great Teacher Onizuka''), a girl student named Miyabi, out of boredom and lack of adult supervision at home, pressures her friends, Chikako and Erika, to go on subsidized dates with older men, and to steal their money when the men are in the showers. When Chikako accidentally meets their teacher Onizuka on one of these dates, enjo-kōsai rookie Onizuka proceeds with it to see these subsidized dates first hand. In the hotel room, Chikako insists that Onizuka take a shower. Onizuka realizes the trap, stops Chikako's attempt to escape, and teaches her a lesson why her first sexual experience should come out of love and not have anything to do with money.  Incidentally, Onizuka (himself a virgin) learns the same lesson from that very occasion.

Conversation over the controversy of enjo-kōsai even finds its way into shows geared toward girls (''[[shōjo]]'') between the ages of 11 and 14 in the form of the highly popular ''[[Gals!|Super Gals!]]'' anime series. During the first episode of the series, straight A student Aya goes on subsidized dates because she wants to have money and fun like the other girls, but also because her strict parents and schedule would not allow her to have a job. Main character Ran, even although she believes the ''[[gyaru]]'' (gal) philosophy “If you want it, go and get it,” strongly disapproves of Aya’s action because she believes a ''gyaru'' should have self-respect and not treat herself like merchandise. Ran tells Aya that they can have fun even without money. Aya becomes persuaded by Ran, and not only do they begin a new friendship, but Aya quits going on subsidized dates as a result.

In Shunji Iwai's film &quot;[[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]&quot;, Shiori Tsuda, a female classmate, is blackmailed by Shusuke Hoshino into enjo-kōsai. The film isn't explicit about whether or not Shiori Tsuda performs sexual favours for her &quot;customers&quot;, but the connotation is present. The depiction within the film of the practice could be considered negative, as the process of being blackmailed into it seems to push the character into some form of mental instability (although it's not clear whether that instability was present prior to the blackmail), culminating in her tragic demise. It is also used as a weapon of control by Hoshino, rather than empowering Tsuda in any way.

==Societal backdrop==
Although the greater part of Japanese society discourages this type of behavior, that has not stopped teachers, monks, government officials, company executives, and others of high social status from being arrested for their involvement with enjo kōsai.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;&gt;Kingston, Jeff.  Japan’s Quiet Transformation: Social Change and Civil Society in the 21st Century. RoutledgeCurzon, New York: 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A study done by the Socioeconomic Research Department at the Nomura Institute of Research showed that in 97 percent of book stores and convenience stores surveyed in 1996 sold “pornographic portrayals of children in either photographic or cartoon form”.&lt;ref&gt;White, Merry Isaacs. Perfectly Japanese: Making Families in an Era of Upheaval.  University of California Press, Berkley: 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as of 1998, Japan was the source of 80 percent of the commercial [[child pornography]] available on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;&gt;Goodman, Roger. Family and Social Policy in Japan: Anthropological Approaches (Contemporary Japanese Society). Cambridge University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, it was not until 1999 that Japan joined the international community in banning child pornography, not out of moral concern, but more so because of the bad publicity the country was receiving.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot; /&gt;

==Government regulation==
Prostitution has been illegal in Japan since 1958, but only prostitutes and [[pimps]] were punished, with customers escaping any penalty from the law. During [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]]’s occupation of Japan, the Child Welfare Law was introduced into legislation as a means to protect children from “lewd behavior”. Many have criticized the law as being too vague to protect Japanese children from sexual abuse and say it does not do enough to keep girls away from sex markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot; /&gt;

During the 1990s enjo kōsai, as well as other forms of child exploitation, gained national attention in Japan leading to international awareness.&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot; /&gt; Due to pressure from outside [[NGO]]s and other industrialized nations, the Japanese government updated its laws relating to child exploitation.  The Law for Punishing Acts Related to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and for Protecting Children, which prohibited an adult from paying a person under the age of 18 for obscene acts, was passed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo bill to outlaw sex with youths for money. New York Times; 04/04/97, Vol. 146 http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=9704242116&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt;  The law made the [[age of consent|legal age limit]] 18 for consenting sexual activities{{Dubious|Age of consent in Japan|date=August 2009}} and punishes the adult offender as the criminal party instead of the child.  

To combat enjo kōsai and other forms of juvenile misbehavior, many [[prefectures]] have instituted a program of {{nihongo|''hodō''|[[:ja:補導|補導]]}}. ''Hodōin'' are  plain-clothed police officers and volunteers who approach youths who appear to be participating in [[juvenile delinquency]] (out past 11 p.m., under-age smoking, wearing expensive accessories, etc.) and offer guidance against such behavior.  When police consider it necessary, teens are taken to a juvenile center or police station for “formal guidance” and entered into a confidential police directory.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot; /&gt; Since enjo kōsai is seen as a moral problem relating to Japanese youth, care is taken not to ostracize the girls but instead give them assistance and advice to steer them away from enjo-kōsai.

==Spread to other countries==
===Taiwan===
While having its foundations in Japan, enjo-kōsai began to spread to other East Asian nations in the late 1990s via media. Enjo-kōsai became popular in Taiwan after the airing of the Japanese ''[[dorama]]'' ''God, Please Give Me More Time'', in which a young woman engages in the activity and suffers social and physical costs. In the end, however, the heroine is able to turn her life around and seems to project a positive image for youth. According to scholar Oi-Wan Lam, Taiwanese teens identified with the love story in plot and the [[subculture]] of the characters. Lam also points to the similarities between Taiwanese and Japanese subcultures, and the notion that enjo-kōsai is not actually an occupation, writing, “Sex work is not recognized by the society as a form of work.”&lt;ref&gt;Oi-Wan Lam, “Why Did Enjo Kōsai Anchor in Taiwan But Not in Hong Kong? Or the Convergence of &quot;Enjo&quot; and “Kōsai&quot; in Teenage Sex Work.” Inter-Asia Cultural Studies; Aug2003, Vol. 4 Issue 2, p353, 11p&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this recognition, teens in both cultures feel they will not suffer consequences for participating in the activity.

A key difference between enjo-kōsai in Japan and Taiwan is the way in which girls set up dates with customers. While telephone clubs were the main venues that facilitated enjo-kōsai in Japan, the Internet facilitates meetings between young girls and clients in Taiwan. Due to this, there have been attempts by several NGOs and the Taiwanese Government to regulate Internet sites. Efforts at regulation are compounded by the fact that NGOs and the Taiwanese government sometimes apply the term enjo-kōsai to mean more than just teenage compensated dating, but also prostitution and Internet pornography sites.

===South Korea===
Enjo-kōsai has also found its way to [[South Korea]], where the South Korean government considers enjo-kōsai a form of prostitution. An annual report by [[ECPAT|ECPAT International]], published in 2004, asserts that 222 girls 18 and younger were arrested for participating in enjo-kōsai in the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshimi Nagamine. The Daily Yomiuri 5 May. 2004. http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T2500913662&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T2500913673&amp;cisb=22_T2500913672&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=145202&amp;docNo=1&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea, similar to Japan, recently passed a law in 2000 protecting children from exploitation and prostitution. Yet due to the nature of enjo-kōsai, specifically the decision of the girl to participate in the act, the girls who do enjo-kōsai are not protected under the law and are subject to punishment under the law.

According to social workers, girls as young as 15 advertise themselves as available for &quot;compensated dating&quot;.&lt;ref name=teen&gt;{{cite news

Some even think they are helping others.&lt;ref name=teen/&gt; The internet allows girls more opportunities to offer to shop, eat out or go to a movie with men in return for payment in order to fulfill their material needs.

[[Image:G-men Issue Number1.jpg|right|thumb|The first issue of the Japanese gay men's magazine ''[[G-men (magazine)|G-men]]'', one of the first magazines to present gay men's manga that was notably different from yaoi, and a major publisher of manga by [[Gengoroh Tagame]] (cover artist for this issue and many others), who was instrumental in creating the bara manga style.]]

{{nihongo|'''''Bara'''''|薔薇||&quot;rose&quot;}}, also known as the [[wasei-eigo]] construction {{nihongo|'''''&quot;Mens' Love&quot;'''''|メンズラブ,|menzu rabu|}} or ML, is a [[Japan]]ese jargon term for a [[genre]] of art and fictional media that focuses on male [[homoeroticism|same-sex love and desire]], usually created by and for [[homosexual]] [[men]]. The bara genre began in the 1960s with [[fetish magazines]] featuring homosexual art and content. Besides bara [[manga]], also called {{nihongo|'''''gei comi'''''|ゲイ　コミ||&quot;gay comics&quot;}}, and illustration, a number of bara [[eroge|erotic games]] exist, as well as novels and memoirs. Bara is mostly a Japanese phenomenon, with limited western exposure through manga [[scanlations]] and online homoerotic art communities. While bara faces difficulties finding western publishers, it has been described as &quot;the next big porn wave coming out of Japan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, Christopher [http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=3&amp;STORY_ID=4057&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=1 Queer love manga style]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bara can vary in visual style and plot, but typically features [[masculine]] men with varying degrees of muscle, body fat, and [[Androgenic hair|body hair]], akin to [[beefcakes]], or [[Bear (gay culture)|bears]] {{nihongo||熊||''kuma''}} in [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|gay culture]]. While bara usually features [[hentai|adult content]] (sometimes violent or exploitative) and homosexual [[romance (genre)|romanticism]], it often has more realistic or autobiographical themes, as it acknowledges the [[taboo]] nature of [[homosexuality in Japan]].

[[western world|Western]] commentators sometimes refer to bara as &quot;[[yaoi]],&quot; but yaoi is largely created by and for women and features idealized [[bishounen]] who conform to the [[heteronormative]] formula of the dominant and masculine [[Yaoi#Seme_and_uke|seme]] pursuing the submissive and effeminate [[Yaoi#Seme_and_uke|uke]].&lt;ref&gt;Linderström, Jenny [http://sh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:15266 Boys' Love: En studie av maskuliniteter och maktrelationer i yaoi manga]&lt;/ref&gt; Yaoi has been criticized for failing to address gay issues. Bara is considered a subgenre of [[Hentai|seijin]] (men's erotica) for gay males and resembles comics for men ([[seinen]]) rather than comics for female readers ([[shoujo manga|shoujo]]/[[josei]]).

==Terminology==
The term ''bara'' in relation to homosexual material for men originated in the 1960s, possibly as a result of ''Bara kei'' (Ordeal by Roses, published in 1961), a collection of semi-nude photographs of the gay author [[Yukio Mishima]] by photographer [[Eikoh Hosoe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackintosh|first=Jonathan D.|date=January 2006|title=Itō Bungaku and the Solidarity of the Rose Tribes [Barazoku]: Stirrings of Homo Solidarity in Early 1970s Japan|journal=Intersections: Gender, History and Culture in the Asian Context |issue=12|page=note 1|issn=1440-9151|url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue12/aoki.html|accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reinforced by the early and influential gay men's magazine {{nihongo|''[[Barazoku]]''|薔薇族||lit. &quot;rose tribe&quot;}}, founded in 1971 and the first gay magazine in Asia to be sold at mainstream bookshops.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesBarazoku&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article493277.ece|title=Voice of gay Japan falls silent after 30 years in the pink|last1=Lewis|first1=Leo|last2=Teeman|first2=Tim|date=October 12, 2004|publisher=TimesOnline|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bara-eiga'' (&quot;rose film&quot;) has been used since the 1980s to describe gay cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
Japan has a history of homosexuality, particularly pederasty, which is represented in [[Shunga|danshoku-shunga]] artwork. However, [[Gengoroh Tagame]] distinguishes between the culturally-defined sexuality of traditions (such as pederasty) and the more personal, innate, and arguably legitimate sexuality found in modern [[homoeroticism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GTIntro&quot;/&gt; 

According to Tagame, the history of modern gay [[erotic art]] in Japan can be traced to ''Fuzokukitan'', a [[fetish magazine]] which ran between 1960 and 1974.  While it contained heterosexuality and [[lesbian]]ism, ''Fuzokukitan'' stood apart from its competitors as it gradually featured more homosexual content and articles, and had male erotic art as its cover several times more frequently than other publications. Western artists [[George Quaintance]] and [[Tom of Finland]], who contributed to American [[Beefcake magazines|physique magazines]], were featured in ''Fuzokukitan'', and several historical bara artists, including [[Okawa Tatsuji]], [[Funayama Sanshi]], [[Mishima Go]] and [[Hirano Go]] made their debut in the magazine, in addition to featured work by popular artists such as [[Oda Toshimi]] and [[Adachi Eikichi]]. A prominent figure behind the publication was writer and editor [[Mamiya Hiroshi]], who later contributed to ''Barazoku.'' The publication continued to grow, but by the end of the 1960s all the previously mentioned artists had left ''Fuzokukitan.''&lt;ref name=&quot;GTIntro&quot;/&gt;

A privately published, small circulation magazine called ''Bara'' was established in 1964 and became &quot;the root of gay magazines.&quot; Mishima, Funayama and Adachi contributed to ''Bara'' after leaving ''Fuzokukitan'', likely the reason for the latter publication's demise. In 1971, ''Barazoku'', the first commercially published gay men's magazine, was established. Several other new magazines, ''Sabu'' and ''Adon'', soon followed, introducing newer artists such as [[Ishihara Gojin]] and [[Hayashi Gekko]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GTIntro&quot;/&gt;

Homoerotic photography has also been accredited as contributing to the bara genre, with [[Tamotsu Yatō]] and [[Haga Kuro]] mentioned by Tagame in particular. In the 1970s and 1980s, gay magazines grew rapidly and began specializing in particular fetishes such as &quot;chubby chasers&quot;, allowing artists to specialize. Foreign gay cultures, art, and lifestyle found there way into publications such as ''MLMW'', increasingly influencing the next second generation of bara artists, including [[Sadao Hasegawa]], published in ''Barazoku, Sabu, Adon, MLMW, Samson,'' and later ''SM-Z'', as well as artists [[Junichi Yamakawa]] and [[Kimura Ben]], whose depiction of men were more sporty and realistic. With the second generation of artists, the generalized sorrow and darkness noticeable in the work of the first generation soon disappeared, as homosexuals in Japan became more liberated. Gay sexualized fantasies shifted from the spiritual beauty of samurai and gangsters to the physical bodies of sportsmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;GTIntro&quot;/&gt; 

After the second generation, in the late 1980s and 1990, the major gay magazines continued publishing but extra issues, picture books, and large-sized magazines disappeared as general interest magazines started to often feature gay interest articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;GTIntro&quot;/&gt; Mid-1990s magazines such as ''Badi'' and ''G-men'' were more inclusive of gay culture and delt with topics such as the gay market, pride parades, HIV-related events, and clubs, although the focus remained on fiction, ads and erotic material. In the early 1990s ''Adon'' attempted to shift its focus onto lifestyle and politics and away from the eroticism and light entertainment typical of the gay magazines of the era, eliminating pornographic features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lunsing|first=Wim|title=The global emergence of gay and lesbian politics: national imprints of a worldwide movement|editor=Barry D.

The demise of ''Barazoku'' has been linked to a preference for coverage of &quot;sex, music, clubbing and fashion, rather than news and politics&quot; among modern readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesBarazoku&quot; /&gt; ''Sabu'' also eventually failed, ceasing publication in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;GTIntro&quot;/&gt;

Today, there are more gay artists and variety featured in gay magazines compared to the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;GTIntro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pot.co.jp/pub_list/pub_book/tachiyomi/4939015580/outline.html |title=Look Inside: Gay Erotic Art in Japan Vol. 1: Artists From the Time of the Birth of Gay Magazines, Compiled by Tagame Gengoroh |publisher=Potto Shuppan |date= |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bara manga, also known as ''gei comi'', is an even smaller niche genre in Japan than yaoi manga;&lt;ref name=Deppeyscans/&gt; none has been licensed in English&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 2007 414&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Jason|title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]|publisher=Del Rey|date=2007|page=414|isbn=0345485904}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although a few of Gengoroh Tagame's works have been published in French&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ho-editions.com/caddie/ficheAuteur.php?IDA=73&amp;UID=2009082901465458.107.231.222|title=FICHE AUTEUR - Gengoroh Tagame|publisher=H&amp;O Editions|language=French|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and not much has been [[scanlation|scanlated]] into English,&lt;ref name=Deppeyscans&gt;{{cite web | title=A Comics Reader's Guide to Manga Scanlations |last= Deppey |first=Dirk |authorlink=Dirk Deppey | url=http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=430&amp;Itemid=70 | publisher=[[The Comics Journal]] | accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''[[Kuso Miso Technique]]'', a 1987 [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] manga published in ''[[Barazoku]]'', has become an Internet meme.&lt;ref name=&quot;zakzak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209214547/http://www.zakzak.co.jp/top/2008_02/t2008020901_all.html|trans_title=The comeback of homomanga popularity on the internet...who is Yamajun?|title=ネット人気でホモマンガ復刻…ヤマジュンって誰だ？|publisher=Zakzak|date=2008-02-09|accessdate=2009-07-11|language= Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular Creators===
Gengoroh Tagame has been called the most influential creator of gay manga in Japan to date. Most of his work first appeared in gay magazines and usually features [[sexual abuse]], including rape, torture, and [[BDSM]]. Tagame's illustrations of  muscular, hairy men have been cited as a catalyst for a shift in fashion among gay men in Tokyo after the launch of ''G-men'' in 1995, away from the clean-shaven and slender styles influenced by [[yaoi]] and towards a tendency for masculinity and chubbiness. &lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt; Tagame's work has been criticized by notable gay manga writer [[Susumu Hirosegawa]] as being merely &quot;SM theatre&quot;, because of its violence and lack of complex storylines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt; Susumu Hirosegawa's early works were yaoi, but later Hirosegawa moved into gay manga. Hirosegawa's works sometimes contain no sex at all, with greater focus on plot, but when sex is present it is often in the form of [[Sadism and masochism|sadomasochism]] or rape, in which the victim learns to enjoy the experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt;

Other very popular and known artists include [[Takeshi Matsu]], [[Inaki Matsumoto]], and [[Matsuzaki Tsukasa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;salestats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ggymeta.wordpress.com/2008/12/08/menslove-sales-stats/ |title=Menslove Sales Stats |publisher=GGYMeta |date=2008-12-08 |accessdate=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publishers===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Prior to the early 2000s, the primary venue for publication of gay men's manga was gay men's general-interest magazines, which have included manga since the inception of ''[[Barazoku]]'' in 1971. The typical manga story in these magazines is an 8-24 page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], although some magazines, notably ''[[G-men (magazine)|G-men]]'', also carry some serialized stories. McLelland, surveying gay men's magazines from the mid to late 1990s, indicates that most manga stories were simply pornographic, with little attention to character or plot, and that even the longer, serialized stories were generally &quot;thinly developed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLelland 2000 136&quot;&gt;{{cite book
  | last = McLelland
  | first = Mark
  | title = Male homosexuality in modern Japan
  | publisher = Routledge
  | date = 2000
  | page = 136
  | isbn = 070071300X}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLelland characterizes ''Barazoku'' as containing &quot;some well-crafted stories which might be better described as erotic rather than pornographic&quot;, while the manga in ''G-men'' were &quot;more relentlessly sexual&quot;, with less attention to characterization and mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = McLelland

  | publisher = Routledge
  | date = 2000
  | page = 135-6
  | isbn = 070071300X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Gengoroh Tagame's early work was published in the magazine ''[[G-men (magazine)|G-men]]'', which was founded in 1994 to cater to gay men who preferred &quot;macho fantasy&quot;, as opposed to the sleeker, yaoi-inspired styles popular in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | publisher = Routledge
  | date = 2000
  | page = 139-140
  | isbn = 070071300X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most gay men's general-interest magazines, ''G-men'' included manga as well as prose stories and editorial and photographic material. ''G-men'' encouraged steady readership by presenting a more well-defined fantasy image, and with serialized, continuing manga stories which encouraged purchase of every issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''G-men'' was also one of the first gay men's publishers to offer collections of manga bound into ''[[tankōbon]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The 1990s saw increased media focus on LGBT people in Japan, and a large increase in the production of works written by gay men. In the mid to late 1990s, several attempts were made at manga anthologies targeted at gay men, but none was successful and most folded after a few issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 2007 414&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AndersonBara&quot;/&gt; In the early 2000s, ''G-men's'' parent company, Furukawa Shobu, began publishing a pair of manga anthology aimed at gay men, ''Bakudan'' (quarterly) and ''Gekidan'' (bimonthly); material from these anthologies are collected into tankōbon under their Bakudan Comics imprint.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndersonBara&quot;/&gt; These magazines were successful, and Furukawa Shobu added other anthologies, including ''Uragekidan''. Shortly thereafter, the [[yaoi]] publisher Aqua (an imprint of Ookura Shuppan) started the manga anthology ''Nikutai Ha'' (AKA ''Muscle Aqua''), and later others, such as ''Oaks'' and ''G's Comics'', to capitalize on a crossover audience of gay male readers as well as female readers who prefer a more masculine body type. These vary between bara and ''gachi muchi'' (see below), and have strong gay male components to their readerships; however, when collected into tankōbon these manga are issued under the same Aqua Comics imprint as Aqua's mainstream yaoi books, and bear the same [[trade dress]],&lt;ref name=&quot;muscleBL&quot;/&gt; making them hard to distinguish on the shelf.

Today there are four major publishers of bara manga anthologies in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicks&quot;/&gt;

===Online Stores and the Foreign Market===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
Some publishers and online stores have extensive English pages and actively seek foreign readers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicks&quot;/&gt; One of the first online stores to carry bara and create pages in English to pursue foreign online shoppers was [[Rainbow Shoppers]], who carry both current and dated gay manga, including [[doujinshi]]. [[JPQueen]] sells almost exclusively to foreign buyers, but do not distinguish between yaoi and bara, making for risky purchases for customers. The [[G-Project Store]], tied to [[Bakudan]]'s ''G-Style'' magazine, does not sell doujinshi but has English pages for foreign buyers. [[GayJP]] sells only published releases and no doujinshi, and cater almost exclusively to Japanese buyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;salestats&quot;/&gt;

===Characteristics of bara manga===
The rise of bara anthologies has promoted longer, serialized stories, but the most common story type is still the single-chapter one-shot. Bara manga usually has muscular men as the lead gay characters, but characters may vary in body type (although they do not approach the feminine litheness common in yaoi). Although some stories contain less idealized and more realistic depictions of the actual life of gay men (gay pride parades, gay marriage issues, &quot;coming out&quot;, realistically played out sex etc.), McLelland and others note that frequently &quot;there is more emphasis upon sex than there is on building an enduring relationship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLelland 2000 136&quot;/&gt; Stories in gay men's general interest magazines from the mid to late 1990s generally present age-, status- or power-structured relationships, where the older or more senior character uses younger or subordinate characters for sexual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Lunsing notes that some of the narrative annoyances that homosexual men express about yaoi manga, such as rape, misogyny, and an absence of a Western-style gay identity, are also present in ''gei comi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt; In more recent manga published in gay-targeted anthologies, stories frequently invert the older-top, younger-bottom dynamic and show younger, shorter, often white-collar &quot;tops&quot; in aggressive pursuit of older, larger, often bearded, typically [[blue-collar]] &quot;bottoms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akibanana.com/?q=node/1661|title=Simona's BL Research Lab: Boys Love for the Boys|last=Simona|date=05/06/2009|publisher=Akibanana|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with yaoi, the &quot;bottom&quot; is often presented as shy, reluctant, or unsure of his sexuality. Non-consensual sex and BDSM are still common themes,&lt;ref name=&quot;BLLab5.13.09&quot;/&gt; although romantic themes are also popular.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndersonBara&quot;/&gt;

==Other media==
===Novels and memoirs===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
{{See also|LGBT literature}}
Since the 1990s &quot;gay boom&quot;, which brought increasing attention and commercial viability to gay-themed media, there have been a number of novels by gay male authors dealing with homosexuality in a realistic, often autobiographical manner.&lt;ref name=Haggerty /&gt; Notable authors include Hiruma Hisao, Nishino Kōji and Ryōsuke Hashiguchi;&lt;ref name=Haggerty /&gt; a number of Hashiguchi's works have been made into films, including ''[[A Touch of Fever]]'' and ''[[Hush! (2001 film)|Hush!]]''.

===Games===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
A number of bara [[eroge|ero-games]] aimed at a gay male audience have been produced in Japan, although the majority are [[dōjin soft]] (noncommercial). Unlike commercial [[BL game|yaoi games]], which are typically produced by subsidiaries of [[bishōjo game]] developers (e.g., [[Nitro+chiral]] is a subsidiary of [[Nitroplus|Nitro+]]), the few commercial bara games have been produced by small independent companies. Bara ero-games are typically [[visual novel]]s, [[dating sim]]s, or &quot;strip&quot; versions of games of skill such as [[pachinko]] or [[English draughts|checkers]].

==Bara versus yaoi==
{{details|Yaoi}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Yaoi'''''|やおい||also known as &quot;Boys' Love&quot; or BL}} is another [[Japan]]ese genre incorporating homosexual romance themes across various media. The genre emerged in the 1970s in a branch of [[shōjo manga|manga aimed at girls]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Haggerty&quot;/&gt; and is still marketed alomost exclusively at women and girls despite some male readership. 
BL creators and fans are careful to distinguish the genre from bara, which is created by and for gay men.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedagogy&quot;&gt;Wilson, Brent; Toku, Masami.

Bara is more true to actual homosexual male relationships, and not the heterosexual-esque relationships between the masculine seme and feminine uke types that are most common in romantic fantasy in women's yaoi manga. In comparison to yaoi, gay men's manga is unlikely to contain scenes of &quot;uncontrollable weeping or long introspective pauses&quot;, and more likely to show characters who are &quot;hairy, very muscular, or have a few excess pounds&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to gay men's manga, yaoi is &quot;more careful to build up a strong sense of character&quot; before sex scenes occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLelland 2000 136&quot;/&gt; 

===Gachi muchi===
Recently a subgenre of BL has been introduced in Japan, so-called &quot;muscley-chubby BL&quot; or '''gachi muchi''' (from ''gacchiri'', muscular, and ''muchimuchi'', chubby) &lt;ref name=&quot;muscleBL&quot;&gt;{{cite web

which offers more masculine body types and is more likely to have gay male authors and artists. Although still marketed primarily to women, &lt;ref name=&quot;muscleBL&quot;/&gt; it is also thought to attract a large crossover gay male audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndersonBara&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Prior to the development of ''gachi muchi'', the greatest overlap between yaoi and bara authors has been in [[BDSM]]-themed publications&lt;ref name=&quot;BLLab5.13.09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akibanana.com/?q=node/1670|title=Simona's BL Research Lab: Reibun Ike, Hyogo Kijima, Inaki Matsumoto|last=Simona|date=05/13/2009|publisher=Akibanana|accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''Zettai Reido'', a yaoi anthology magazine which had a number of openly male contributors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yaoi Debate&quot;/&gt; Several female yaoi authors who have done BDSM-themed yaoi have been recruited to contribute stories to BDSM-themed bara anthologies or special issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;BLLab5.13.09&quot;/&gt;

The phrase is a reference to [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s book, ''[[Lolita]]'', in which a middle-aged man becomes sexually obsessed with a 12-year-old girl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot;&gt;Kinsella, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent term for attraction to (or art pertaining to erotic portrayal of) young boys is [[shotacon]].

Some critics claim that the lolicon genre contributes to actual [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse of children]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Today&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot; /&gt; while others claim that there is no evidence for this,&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Association Japan&quot; /&gt; or that there is evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond and Uchiyama&quot; /&gt; Although several countries have attempted to [[criminalize]] lolicon's sexually explicit forms as a type of [[child pornography]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WorldofYaoi&quot;&gt;McLelland, Mark.

==In Japan==
Generally, lolicon is a term used to describe a sexual attraction to younger girls, or girls with [[neoteny|youthful characteristics]]. In other words, it can refer to actual or perceived [[pedophilia]] and [[ephebophilia]]. Strictly speaking, ''Lolita complex'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] refers only to the [[paraphilia]] itself, but the abbreviation ''lolicon'' can refer to an individual that has the paraphilia as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWD&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31844488_ITM|title=On the drawing board. (Lehmann Maupin gallery)|author=Rosemary Feitelberg|work=[[Women's Wear Daily]]|ate=2007-06-22|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lolicon is a widespread phenomenon in Japan, where it is a frequent subject of scholarly articles and criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultmanga&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kinsella|first=Sharon|title=Adult Manga|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2000|ISBN=0-8248-2318-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many general bookstores and newsstands openly offer illustrated lolicon material, but there has also been police action against lolicon manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultmanga&quot;/&gt; There are also stores that specifically target the lolicon audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Today&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/kuchikomi/292|title='Rorikon' trade nurturing a fetish for young females|publisher=[[Japan Today]]|date=2004-03-22|accessdate=2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumers are said to be [[white-collar worker]]s in their 20s and 30s who do not complain about the high prices of lolicon merchandise such as figurines and accessories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Today&quot; /&gt;

The &quot;[[kawaii]]&quot; style (which translates to &quot;cute&quot;) is extremely popular in Japan, where it is present in many of the manga/anime styles.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Darker Side of Cuteness,&quot; ''The Economist'', May 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  The school-aged girl in a school uniform is also an erotic symbol in Japan, comparable to the image of a woman in a mini-skirt in the United States.  [[Burusera]] shops cater to men with lolicon complexes by selling unwashed panties, men can make dates with teenagers through [[terekura]] (&quot;telephone clubs&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Breaking the Mold,&quot; ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' October 7, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and school girls moonlight as prostitutes in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56844390.html|title=Teen prostitutes sell favors after school in Tokyo|author=Willis Witter|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=1997-04-06|accessdate=2008-01-13|format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, these create the &quot;strange [[collusion]] which exists in Japanese culture between the hentai (pervert) and the kawaii (cute).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;TURNING JAPANESE? ;TURNING JAPANESE? I REALLY THINK SO,&quot; by Nick Currie. The Herald (Glasgow), September 26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, the [[Etiquette in Asia#Elders|great cultural respect]] associated with old age would make it incompatible with portraying [[ecchi]] behavior in manga, except in a greatly exaggerated farce context (typical examples being &quot;Dirty Old Men&quot;, ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'''s [[Muten-Rôshi]], Master [[Happosai]] in ''[[Ranma ½]]'').

Sexual manga featuring children or childlike characters are called lolicon manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;adultmanga&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, Ken. ''The Subcultures Reader'', 2nd ed. Oxon: Routledge, 2005. p. 547.

Common focuses of these stories include taboo relationships, such as between a teacher and student or brother and sister, while others feature sexual experimentation between children. Some lolicon manga cross over with other [[hentai]] genres, such as [[crossdressing]] and [[futanari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adultmanga&quot;/&gt; ''[[Kodomo no Jikan]]'' is an example of a series that, while not pornographic, draws on lolicon themes for its plot.

Lolicon is a subject of study in the [[Superflat]] exhibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling82&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76667059.html|title=&quot;Superflat&quot; art from Japan collapses hierarchies by merging &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; art, populist and elite genres, advertising and noncommercial media, even 2-D and 3-D concepts|author=May Abbe|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=2001-07-20|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
The use of the term &quot;Lolita complex&quot; in Japan began in the early 1970s with the translation of [[Russell Trainer]]'s ''The Lolita Complex''. Shinji Wada used the word in his {{nihongo|''Stumbling upon a cabbage field''|キャベツ畑でつまづいて|Kyabetsu-batake de tsumazuite|}}, an ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' manga parody in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;KyabetsuBatake&quot;&gt;[[Shinji Wada]], &quot;Kyabetsu-batake de tsumazuite&quot; in ''[[Bessatsu Margaret]]'', June, 1974, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; However, the &quot;lolicon manga&quot; genre closely related to manga media began with [[Hideo Azuma]]'s works, such as {{nihongo|''The machine which came from the sea''|海から来た機械|Umi kara kita Kikai|}}, in the early 1980s. Azuma had been publishing some sexual manga featuring young girls in his own self-published magazine ''Cybele'' prior to that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReviewOfLoliconDojinshi&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} Maruta Hara and Kazuo Shimizu, {{nihongo|&quot;The Lolicon Dōjinshi Reviews&quot;|ロリコン同人誌レビュー|Rorikon dōjinshi rebyū}}[http://azicon1.at.infoseek.co.jp/1980S.htm]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}} in ''Apple Pie'', March, 1982, p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Azuma's works became popular among schoolboy readers because most of the pornographic manga up until then had featured mature women influenced by [[gekiga]], but Azuma's works are not pornographies in a strict sense though they contain many sexual elements. Following Azuma's success, some pornographic manga magazines, such as ''[[Manga Burikko]]'' and ''[[Lemon People]]'', began featuring prepubescent girls. Throughout the 1980s, notable lolicon mangaka who published in these magazines include [[Nonki Miyasu]], [[Kamui Fujiwara]], [[Yoshito Asari]] and [[Aki Uchida]].

===Gender roles===
[[Image:Lolimanga.JPG|thumb|Lolicon manga.]]

Sharon Kinsella wrote that lolicon manga was a late-1980s outgrowth of girls' manga,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot; /&gt; which included [[yaoi|male homosexual love stories]] and parodies of boys' and adult manga.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella, 304.&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred as more men attended amateur manga conventions and as new boys' amateur manga genres appeared at [[Comiket]]. Kinsella distinguished between the attitudes toward gender of amateur lolicon manga and that of male fans of girls' manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot; /&gt; While parody manga created by women ridicule male stereotypes and appeal to both male and female fans, lolicon manga &quot;usually features a girl heroine with large eyes and a body that is both voluptuous and child-like, scantily clad in an outfit that approximates a cross between a 1970s bikini and a space-age suit of armor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kinsella305&quot; /&gt; This latter feature expresses both fear and desire for young women, who have become increasingly powerful in Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, 82. Kinsella, 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella noted dominant British and American genres and imports of animation video in the 1990s derived from lolicon manga, suggesting women in all of these countries have gone through similar social and cultural experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsella, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Female mangaka who draw what has been interpreted as lolicon include [[Chiho Aoshima]] (''The red-eyed tribe'' billboard),&lt;ref&gt;Darling, 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aya Takano]] (''Universe Dream'' wall painting),&lt;ref&gt;Darling, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaworu Watashiya]] (''[[Kodomo no Jikan]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/industry-comments/2007-05-29/jason-deangelis-nymphet|title=Seven Seas Entertainment Talks about ''Nymphet''|author=Jason DeAngelis|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2007-05-29|accessdate=2008-01-18|quote=&quot;...those who are speaking out against Nymphet seem to be disturbed by the relationship between two characters in the story, namely an elementary school student and her adult teacher.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yukiru Sugisaki]] (''[[Rizelmine]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15697680_ITM|title=Rizelmine (book review)|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=2005-09-19|accessdate=2008-01-18|quote=&quot;...this irrational and unsettling love story will disturb all but the most dedicated shonen manga otaku.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Male artists include [[Henmaru Machino]] (untitled, aka ''Green Caterpillar's Girl)'', [[Hitoshi Tomizawa]] (''[[Alien 9]]'', ''Milk Closet''), and Borne (sculptures).&lt;ref name=&quot;Darling82&quot; /&gt;

Japanese animator [[Hayao Miyazaki]] said in a 1988 interview with ''[[Animage]]'' that while he prefers to have female [[protagonist]]s, &quot;It's difficult. They immediately become the subjects of rorikon gokko (play toy for Lolita Complex guys). In a sense, if we want to depict someone who is affirmative to us, we have no choice but to make them as lovely as possible. But now, there are too many people who shamelessly depict (such protagonists) as if they just want (such girls) as pets, and things are escalating more and more.&quot;  He expressed concern as to what this might mean for &quot;[[human rights]] for women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/heroines.html#s3 original source: ''Animage'', vol. 125, November 1988] Retrieved 2007-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside Japan==
{{Expand|section|date=January 2008}}
The meaning of ''lolicon'' has evolved much in the [[Western world#Modern definitions|Western world]], as have the meanings of other words such as ''[[anime]]'', ''[[otaku]]'' and ''[[hentai]]''. In the West, ''lolicon'' refers to anime or manga that contains sexual or erotic portrayals of [[puberty|prepubescent]] or childlike characters, and is thus close cognate to the Japanese term ''lolicon manga''. The use of the word ''lolicon'' in the West is an indication that the material is overtly, even if not explicitly, erotic.&lt;ref name=amrgloss&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amr.nextstudio.net/html/gloss_lolicon.html|title=Glossary Entry: Lolicon|publisher=''Anime Meta-Review''|accessdate=2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20040427zg.html |title=Does comic relief hurt kids?&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Laws have been enacted to criminalize &quot;obscene images of children, no matter how they are made,&quot; for preventing abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=President Signs PROTECT Act|publisher=White House|date=2003-04-30|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/04/20030430-6.html|accessdate=2007-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument is that obscene fictional images portray children as [[sex object]]s, thereby contributing to [[child sexual abuse]]. This argument has been disputed by the claim that there is no scientific basis for that connection,&lt;ref&gt;In [http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/Supreme_Court/briefs/00-795/2000-0795.pet.aa.html Free Speech Coalition v. Reno] (later Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition), the court held that &quot;[f]actual studies that establish the link between computer-generated child pornography and the subsequent sexual abuse of children apparently do not yet exist.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and that restricting sexual expression in drawings or animated games and videos might actually increase the rate of sexual crime by eliminating a harmless outlet for desires that could motivate crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Association Japan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iajapan.org/hotline/center/20060531public.html|title=「ホットライン運用ガイドライン案」等に対する意見の募集結果について|publisher=Internet Association Japan|date=2006-05-31|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is exemplified in a case involving a man from [[Virginia]] who asserted at his arrest that after viewing lolicon at a public library, he had quit collecting real child pornography and switched to lolicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/wb/xp-85976|title=Man will serve 10 months for child porn|author=Mike Allen|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|date=2006-10-07|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural critic [[Hiroki Azuma]] said that very few readers of lolicon manga commit crimes. In the [[otaku]] culture, lolicon is the &quot;most convenient [form of rebellion]&quot; against society.&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20040427zg.html|title=Does comic relief hurt kids?|author=Tony McNicol|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=2004-04-27|accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Diamond]] and Ayako Uchiyama observe a strong correlation between the dramatic rise of pornographic material in Japan from the 1970s onwards and a dramatic decrease in reported sexual violence, including crimes by juveniles and assaults on children under 13. They cite similar findings in [[Denmark]] and [[West Germany]]. In their summary, they state that the concern that countries with widespread availability of sexually explicit material would suffer increased rates of sexual crimes was not validated; and that the reduction of sexual crimes in Japan during that period may have been influenced by a variety of factors they had described in their study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond and Uchiyama&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_rape_jp.html|title=Pornography, Rape and Sex Crimes in Japan|author=[[Milton Diamond]] and Ayako Uchiyama|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–22|year=1999|accessdate=2008-01-06|doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(98)00035-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharon Kinsella observed an increase in unsubstantiated accounts of schoolgirl [[prostitution]] in the media in the late 1990s, and speculated that these unproven reports developed in counterpoint to the increased reporting on [[comfort women]]. She speculated that, &quot;It may be that the image of happy girls selling themselves voluntarily cancels out the other guilty image.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;comic relief&quot; /&gt;

A Japanese non-profit organization called CASPAR has claimed that lolicon and other anime magazines and games do encourage [[sex crime]]s. The group, founded in 1989, campaigns for regulation of depiction of minors in pornographic magazines and video games.&lt;ref name=AnimeNewsNetwork&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-01-13/lolicon-backlash-in-japan &quot;Lolicon Backlash in Japan&quot;] Anime News Network 01/13/2005. Retrieved 2007-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Public attention was brought to bear on this issue when [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]] kidnapped and murdered four girls between the ages of 4 and 7 in 1988 and 1989, committing acts of [[necrophilia]] with their corpses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/nn20060118a2.html &quot;Serial killer Miyazaki must hang: Supreme Court&quot;], ''The Japan Times''. 01/18/2006.

Public sentiment against sexual cartoon depictions of minors was revived in 2005 when a convicted [[sex offender]], who was arrested for the murder of a seven-year-old girl in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], was suspected as a lolicon.&lt;ref name=AnimeNewsNetwork/&gt; Despite media speculation, it was found that the murderer, [[Kaoru Kobayashi]], seldom had interest in manga, games or dolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20050206t3.html|title=Otaku harassed as sex-crime fears mount|accessdate=2008-01-06|author=|date=2005-02-06|work=|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed, however, that he had become interested in small girls after watching an animated pornographic video as a high school student.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nakamura&quot;&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20050518f1.htm &quot;Child porn, if animated, eludes regulators&quot;], by Akemi Nakamura, ''The Japan Times''. 05/18/2005. Retrieved 2007-06-07.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to death by hanging.

According to Michiko Nagaoko, director of a non-profit organization in [[Kyoto]] called Juvenile Guide, founded in 2003, approximately half of the 2,000 pornographic animation titles distributed in Japan every year, including films and video games, feature [[schoolgirl]] characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nakamura&quot;/&gt;

On March 11, 2008, [[UNICEF]] Japan issued a statement calling for further tightening of [[child pornography]] laws in Japan, including the ban of sexual depictions of minors in manga, anime and computer games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUKT20430220080311|title=UNICEF says Japan failing to control child porn|last=Reynolds|first=Isabel|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a ban, however, is not being considered by Japan officials for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/mar/10/japan|title=Japan to outlaw possession of child porn|last=McCurry|first=Justin|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yua Aida'''|あいだゆあ|Aida Yua}} is an award-winning Japanese [[Model (person)|model]] and former [[AV idol]].

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Yua Aida was born in [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan, on 12 August 1984. Aida was an active girl and involved in many sporting activities during primary and middle school. Tennis was her strongest sport throughout middle school. In high school, she changed her focus on sports to art, an interest she attributes to her mother. Aida reports that exposure to nude models while oil painting helped her to be more comfortable when she began her AV career.&lt;ref name=&quot;sexasian-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070714215700/http://www.sexasian18.com/actress.php?id=1301#tab=2|archivedate=2007-07-14|url=http://www.sexasian18.com/actress.php?id=1301#tab=2|title=Yua Aida - Stark Naked Interview|accessdate=2009-01-05|last=Aida|first=Yua|publisher=www.sexasian18.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her graduation from high school, Aida began working at a part-time job. At this time she was scouted by an AV talent agency while shopping in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku]] neighborhood. Aida says that she was not impressed with the talent scout, but when she met the company president, she thought, &quot;This guy is really great. I’m gonna work here!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sexasian-interview&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut and early career===
Aida debuted in photo layouts in 2003, and made her AV debut in the January 2004 DVD release ''Pichi Pichi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2004.htm|title=2004|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A co-production of the [[Kuki Inc.|KUKI]] and MAX-A labels, ''Pichi Pichi'' had Aida playing the role of a student writing a final paper for school on the subject of ecstasy. This concept allowed Aida to perform with a variety of AV actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1313|title=''Pichi Pichi''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aida's second video, ''Your Yua Aida'' (February 2004) left the fictional narrative format to explore the documentary style common with Japanese adult videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schönherr|first=Johannes|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/company-matsuo-and-the-world-of-japanese-adult-video.shtml|title=Japanese AV - A Short Introduction|date=29 December 2006|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com Midnight Eye]|quote=The majority of Japanese AVs employ elements of documentary filmmaking to some degree.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her March release, ''Voyage'', Aida played the role of a photographer who fantasizes about having sex with the male models she photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2327|title=''Voyage/ Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Praudia'' (May 2004) had Aida in the role of a bar girl competing with other girls for the customers' interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2335|title=''Praudia / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month as this release, Aida starred in an &quot;image&quot; video for the Shuffle label. Featuring nude modeling without sex, the video was titled ''The Naked''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SFBV012|title=''The Naked / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aida appeared in a similar DVD, ''Maximum'', for Kuki in June, 2004. The 60 minutes of new &quot;image video&quot; modeling was padded with scenes from two of her previous releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KTD083|title=''MAXIMUM / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June, Aida released ''Lesson 4'', an AV for Kuki in which she plays a teacher in an all-male school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT706|title=''LESSON 4''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aida's next release, ''Curved Line Beauties'' (July 2004) was another &quot;image&quot; video, with the model appearing in various revealing clothing, and oiling herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2348|title=''Curved Line Beauties''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sweat'', released in August, focused on Aida's athletic abilities, and her tendency to perspire easily. Mountain biking was one of the forms of exercise featured in the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT712|title=''SWEAT''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aida appeared in MAX-A's ''Female Teacher Hunt'' series in September 2004. In her entry in the series, ''Female Teacher Hunt in Yua Aida: Wet wet wet...'', Aida played the coach of a male synchronized swimming team. When the team fails in a competition, they take turns raping Aida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2356|title=''Female Teacher Hunt in Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was again playing the part of a teacher in the October 2004 Kuki release ''Tell You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT720|title=''Tell You / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 2004 she was being called the Number One AV actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KTD090|title=''KUBIRE''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aida's entry in MAX-A's ''Welcome to Max Cafe!'' series focused on ''[[cosplay]]''. In this November 2004 release, she wore a [[cheerleader]]'s costume, a wedding dress, a bunny, and in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2367|title=''Welcome to Max Cafe! / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''If...'', Aida appeared in a variety of fantasy scenarios. Her character in the video changed situations whenever she opened a door. Among the roles she played in the video were a rape victim, a secretary and a stripper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2376|title=''if... / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aida appeared in ''Lusting Uniform Collection'' in April 2005 with a variety of other AV idols, including [[Naho Ozawa]] and [[Sora Aoi]]. The video was described as, &quot;for the people, by the people, of the people who love school uniforms!!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2390|title=''Lusting Uniform Collection''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, she released ''Endless'', an AV that purported to dramatize an actual event from Aida's life. The video had Aida as the victim of a molester who ejaculated on her school uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT749|title=''ENDLESS / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her original releases, Aida's videos were anthologized many times in such collections as ''Blur File'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XV427|title=''Blur File, Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Premium BEST'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XV270|title=''Premium BEST / Yua Aida''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three ''Samantha'' collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XV243|title=''Samantha / Yua Aida Vol.3''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year of her debut, she had appeared in over 30 videos.

===Later career===
In Spring 2005, after more than a year working for [[Kuki Inc.|Kuki]] and MAX-A, Aida joined a new studio, [[S1 No. 1 Style]], and released her first video with them, ''Sell Debut'', directed by [[Hideto Aki]], in May 2005. Along with [[Sora Aoi]] and [[Yuma Asami]], she was one of the most popular figures at the S1 studio - in the DMM list of the top 100 actresses by sales, she placed #1 in 2005 and #4 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/ranking/=/mode=year/aetas=2005/article=actress/rank=1_20

In mid-2007, she also starred in four videos in the [[Moodyz]] Diva series which features prominent AV idols.

==Life and career==
Kokoro was born 30 August 1982 in the city of [[Miyako, Iwate|Miyako]], [[Iwate Prefecture]], Japan. She was seeking employment at the time that she was recruited for work in the AV industry. An AV scout found her in the audience of a TV gameshow.&lt;ref name=&quot;downloadjav filmography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://downloadjav.com/actresses/actress.cfm?filename=kokoro_amano|title=Kokoro Amano|accessdate=2007-07-25|publisher=[http://downloadjav.com/ downloadjav.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stage name was given to her by comedian Makoto Kitano, who interviewed her on the [[TV Asahi]] variety show [[:ja:トゥナイト2|''Tonight 2'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tentacle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;videoboy-sunny&quot;/&gt; Her AV debut was in the December, 2001 release ''Confusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2001.htm|title=2001|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made for the [[Alice Japan]] label, and directed by Kazuhito Kuramoto, the video told the story of a couple, both of whom aspire to be actors. Amano's character has been secretly appearing in adult videos, and is afraid that her boyfriend will find out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2051|title=''Confusion''|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have often pointed out the documentary-inspired format of many Japanese AVs, which often begin with a lengthy interview with the main actress of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/round-up_005.shtml|title=''Every Japanese Woman Makes Her Own Curry '' (review)|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|date= |accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com Midnight Eye]|quote=The similarities between the... [documentary and hardcore Adult Video] have been picked up on by critics numerous times before. One further documentary-inspired peculiarity of Japanese AV films is the lengthy interviews that usually precede the sex sequences...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amano's second video for [[Alice Japan]] makes use of this format, by including her lengthy network television ''Tonight 2'' interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;videoboy-sunny&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videoboy.tv/product/p100001862.html|title=天野こころ日だまりの恋|accessdate=2009-08-23|publisher=[http://www.videoboy.tv/ www.videoboy.tv]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in January 2002, and titled ''Sunny Love'', Amano's usage of her native Iwate accent in the interview was a selling-point of the video. Further documentary-inspired aspects of the video included outdoor sex in the countryside, and rape scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunny Love&quot;/&gt; Amano's February 2002 AV for Alice Japan, ''Sealed Love'', returned to the fictional narrative format of her first work. In this video, again directed by Kuramoto, she plays an employee of an IT company who has fallen in love with the best friend of her boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2059|title=''Sealed Love''|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Kokoro's later videos for [[Alice Japan]] continued in the purely fictional narrative format. In ''My Lovely Nurse Sister'' she plays the role of a nurse who has sex with doctors, and her brother-in-law who is a patient at the hospital where she works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV161|title=''My Lovely Nurse Sister''|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her July 2002 DVD for VIP, ''Kokoro Amano [R]'', is a game in which Kokoro plays the viewer's younger sister. Different endings result depending on selections made during the watching of the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kokoro Amano [R]&quot;/&gt;

Kokoro's career took the path of the AV idol who debuts as an inexperienced &quot;new face,&quot; and whose sexual performances become progressively more outlandish. Regarding this type of AV career, Kjell Fornander says, &quot;Viewers are invited to follow, from appearance to appearance, her sexual initiation, dawning self-awareness and gradual acceptance of her inner, dark depths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-05-20|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|publisher=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Erotic Mind'', her next AV for Alice Japan, had Kokoro making her first steps into the more adventurous themes that her later videos would explore. This video includes scenes of voyeurism, sex in public restrooms, vibrators and a threesome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2063|title=''Erotic Mind''|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her July 2002 video for Cosmos Plan was her wildest venture yet, including sex with four men at once, S&amp;M and saliva-swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=BR05|title=''Fallen Angel X''|accessdate=2007-05-20|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2002 she signed exclusive agreement with studio [[Soft On Demand]] and the first movie that came from this relationship was the popular ''24 Hours of Bukkake Anytime and Anywhere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=3078|title=ActionJAV 24 Hours of Semen|accessdate=2008-09-23|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas that made this movie interesting were:

* Kokoro agrees to live 24 hours in an apartment designated by the studio, starting at 1:00PM.
* Apartment next door is inhabited by a group of about 20 men who can see Kokoro's activity realtime through a set of seven fixed [[CCD camera]]s installed in her apartment.
* Whenever they want (even at night) they can enter Kokoro's apartment and ejaculate on any part of her body ([[Bukkake]]), but they cannot touch her or talk to her. If any indication is required, they have to express it with gestures.

Kokoro also worked in the ''[[gokkun]]'' genre in the video ''Gokkun Bazooka 150 Shots (Special 2003)'', in which she swallowed up to 175 [[cum shot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=4733|title=ActionJAV Gokkun Bazooka 150 Counts Special |accessdate=2008-09-23|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired from the AV industry in 2004.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

==Life and career==
===Debut and early AVs===
Born in [[Tokyo]] on [[March 28]], [[1980]], Minori Aoi was active in tennis during Junior High School and High School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minori_Aoi_JMate_Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_48.html|last=Woo|first=Ex-S (translator)|title=Body Park: Aoi Minori (Interview)|accessdate=2007-04-23|language=English|work=www.jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her AV debut in the February, 1999 release, ''Pure Heart'' (純心).&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1999.htm|title=1999|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first video was a difficult experience for her. She recalls, &quot;I really hated it at the time. I think I also cried during then... it's the worst one I've been in. It's definitely not something I could recommend to my fans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minori_Aoi_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt;

In November of her debut year, Aoi starred in ''Dreaming Sailor'', a campus drama.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dreaming Sailor&quot;/&gt; ''I Love Big Needle'' from January 2000 had Aoi playing the role of a nurse who is subject to sexual abuse from both the doctors and her patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IT02|title=''I Love Big Needle''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Angel'', released later the same month, Aoi acted as an angel who comes to earth to satisfy mortal desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MDS020|title=''ANGEL''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fetish Virgin IV'' from March 2000, subtitled ''Costume Play Mania'', featured Aoi in the popular ''[[cosplay]]'' genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2183|title=''Fetish Virgin IV''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comeback===
[[File:Minori Aoi 2nd International Healthy City Conference.jpg|thumb|right|Minori Aoi in a promotion for the 2nd International Healthy City Conference in the People's Republic of China.]]
Described at the American ''[[Adult Film Database]]'' as having a &quot;melting smile [and] wonderfully white skin,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adultfilmdatabase.com/video.cfm?videoid=53278|title=''Minori Aoi - Precious Moments'' (review)|accessdate=2007-04-23|language=English|work=[[Adult Film Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aoi quickly became a popular star of adult video, image video, photo books, and magazine appearances. However, even after her success, she retained her ambivalent attitude towards the AV profession, saying &quot;I still can't get used to shooting in front of a camera though. There are some that enjoy it or get turned on by it, but I still get nervous even after fifteen tapes. There are times when I ponder about running out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minori_Aoi_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt; She retired from the AV industry briefly in 2000, and returned in March of 2001 in the video ''Minori Aoi - Underground Job''. The AV had Aoi playing the role of a room service maid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IT92|title=''Minori Aoi - Underground Job''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second come-back video, ''Confinement'' (April 2001), was in the bondage genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IT97|title=''Confinement''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to this point in her career, Aoi had appeared mainly with the Cosmos Plan label. In June, 2001, she released her first video under Sexia's Try Heart label. Entitled ''I Want To Fellatio'', the video focused on Aoi's oral sex techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA216|title=''I Want To Fellatio''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD version of this film included an instructional &quot;How to Have an Orgasm&quot; demonstration given by Aoi in a cheerleader costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SXD016|title=''I Want To Fellatio'' [DVD]|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Aoi was featured in the fashion magazine ''An An'' in 2003, and in November of that year Cosmos Plan re-issued her work for the company in three volumes, and collected into one box set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MDH014|title=''Cosmos Memorial Minori Aoi Complete Box''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aoi was in the international spotlight in October 2006 when she appeared in a controversial promotional campaign for the 2nd International Healthy City Conference in the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/葵みのり|title=葵みのり (Aoi Minori)|accessdate=2007-04-23|language=Japanese|work=[[Japanese Wikipedia]]}} ''and'' {{cite web |url=http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/葵實野理|title=葵實野理|accessdate=2007-04-23|language=Chinese|work=[[Chinese Wikipedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.hankooki.com/lpage/world/200701/h2007012507574875170.htm|title=중국 포스터 속 '백의천사'의 진실?|date=2007-01-25|accessdate=2008-01-29|language=Korean|publisher=[[Hankook Ilbo]]}}

{{nihongo|'''Kate Asabuki'''|朝吹ケイト|Asabuki Keito}} is a Japanese actress who appeared in Nikkatsu's ''[[Roman Porno]]'' films of the 1980s, and was an early AV (Adult Video) performer.

==Life and career==
Asabuki studied [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] in college, and joined [[Nikkatsu]] to work in their ''Roman Porno'' films in 1982, while still attending university. She took her stage name &quot;Kate&quot; from [[Kate Bush]], who was her favorite singer.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kate Asabuki - A pictorial&quot;, ''Asian Cult Cinema'' #22, p.32-33&lt;/ref&gt; One of her earliest Nikkatsu appearances was in the sixth entry of the ''Female Teacher'' (Onna Kyoshi) series (1977-1983), director Junchi Suzuki's ''Hunting The Female Teacher'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-889288-52-7|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Nikkatsu, Asabuki appeared in several films directed by Atsushi Fujiura, and it is rumored that they were secretly married to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.227.&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in Fujiura's ''Lady's Triangle'' (''Ojosan No Matagura'') (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0286859/|title=''Ojosan no matagura'' (1983)|accessdate=2007-03-04|work=[[IMDB]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujiura also directed one of Asabuki's most successful films, ''Koichiro Uno's Dancer Of Izu'' (''Uno Koichiro No Izu No Odoriko'') (1984). Nikkatsu's ''Koichiro Uno'' series consisted of humorous sex stories featuring strong female leads. The series was conceived as ''Roman Pornos'' designed to appeal to women, and films that couples could enjoy together. This entry, called the best in the series, was a parody of [[Yasunari Kawabata]]'s famous story, ''[[The Dancing Girl of Izu]]''. In Uno's version, Kawabata's titular classical dancer was instead a stripper.&lt;ref&gt; Weisser, p.447-448&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent ''pinku eiga'' directors for whom Asabuki acted were [[Shogoro Nishimura]] in ''Woman with the Pierced Nipples'' (''Chikubi Ni Pierce O Shita Onna'') (1983),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citwf.com/film375253.htm|title=''CHIKUBI NI PIERCE O SHITA ONNA / WOMAN WITH PIERCED NIPPLES''|accessdate=2007-03-04|work=[http://www.citwf.com/ Complete Index to World Film]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Masaru Konuma]] in ''Stewardess Scandal: Hold Me Like an Animal'' (Stewardess Scandal: Kemono No Youni Dakishimete) (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citwf.com/film63131.htm|title=''STEWARDESS SCANDAL: KEMONO NO YOUNI DAKISHIMETE / STEWARDESS SCANDAL: HOLD ME LIKE AN ANIMAL / FLY GIRLS IN ACTION, THE''|accessdate=2007-03-04|work=[http://www.citwf.com/ Complete Index to World Film]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to comment on Asabuki, Konuma said, &quot;A nice girl. Very responsive. One of the only actresses who could speak multiple languages. I had her talk English in one of the sex scenes. I liked the way it sounded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Konuma, Masaru. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser on November 6, 1998, in ''Asian Cult Cinema'', #22, 1st Quarter, 1999. p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s Asabuki was an anchor on the weekly TV program ''Tokyo Rock TV''. She continued her studies in [[England]], and hoped to work as an actress in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kate Asabuki - A pictorial&quot;, ''Asian Cult Cinema'' #22, p.32-33&lt;/ref&gt; a country she had visited four times by 1989. In 1999 she made a fifth trip to the U.S. to model for photographer [[Ron Vogel]] for several American magazines, including ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' and ''[[Hustler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Asabuki, Kate. (1999). &quot;Hollywood or Bust - Memoirs of America&quot; in ''Asian Cult Cinema'' #25, 4th Quarter, 1999. p.59&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her appearances in American media, ''Celebrity Sleuth'' magazine named her one of &quot;The 25 Sexiest Women of 2001.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0996396/publicity Kate Asabuki publicity] at [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as a &quot;shy girl with F-cup boobs,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TAWAWA DVD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV099|title=''TAWAWA'' (DVD)|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/main.htm XCity]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after nearly three years in the field, by 2004 Ayana was being called &quot;the top idol of AV.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=12ID031|title=''NONSTOP / Kyoko Ayana''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/main.htm XCity]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Payne, founder of the Japanese popular culture site, J-List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jardin|first=Xeni|url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/1,63009-0.html|title=Fix for Japan Pop-Culture Addicts|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://www.wired.com/ wired.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayana had &quot;claimed Japan's top big breast idol spot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne-Ayana&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Payne|first=Peter|url=http://www.jmate.com/reviews/article_153.html|title=''4 HOURS of Kyoko Ayana'' (DVD review)|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://www.jmate.com/ jmate.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
There are two types of AV studios in Japan, the &quot;pros&quot; and the &quot;indies.&quot; The &quot;pro&quot; companies work with Sof-Rin, the Japanese Software Morality Association. Sof-Rin sets rules and guidelines for what can be shown in AVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/reviews/article_151.html|title=''Bad Girl -- Ami Ayukawa'' (DVD Review)|accessdate=2007-06-09|last=Leongolo|publisher=www.jmate.com|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Payne, the &quot;indies&quot; companies have greater freedom, and are able to get the best directors and produce a better product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/reviews/article_161.html|title=''Super Angle of Oppai ~ Premium Edition -- Anna Ohura'' (DVD Review)|accessdate=2007-06-09|last=Payne|first=Peter|publisher=www.jmate.com|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayana has worked with a variety of companies, primarily with the &quot;indies&quot; such as [[Moodyz]], but also with big labels [[Alice Japan]], [[Kuki Inc.|KUKI]], Cosmos Plan and TMA.

===Alice Japan (August - December 2001)===
Ayana made her debut in the August 2001 [[Alice Japan]] video, ''Tawawa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2001.htm|title=2001|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TAWAWA DVD&quot;/&gt; In this video and some of her later videos, such as ''Boobies'' (September, 2001), and ''TRY 1.2.3！'', the shyness of Ayana's performance was remarked upon.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2041|title=''Boobies''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/main.htm XCity]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TRY&quot;&gt;

This documentary-style video dealt with Ayana's sex life as a high school girl.&lt;ref&gt;

===KUKI (January - March 2002)===
In January 2002, Ayana released the first of her three original AVs with [[Kuki Inc.]]. All three were directed by [[Hideto Aki]]. &quot;I love to fuck girls for fun,&quot; says Kyoko Ayana. For her first video with the company, Ayana was chosen to star in the first entry in their ''Big Breast Aliens'' video series.&lt;ref&gt;

''Illusion of F-cup'', released in February, focused on [[breast fetishism]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Ayukawa made her AV debut in November 1999 at the age of eighteen with the [[h.m.p. (Japan)|h.m.p.]] Tiffany label.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1999.htm|title=1999|accessdate=2007-07-05|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first appearance for the MAX-A company's Samansa (Samantha) label was in the August 2000 ''[[cosplay]]''-themed video, ''Scanties''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2199|title=''Scanties''|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayukawa's entry in MAX-A's ''The Confined Bodydolls'' series, subtitled ''Ami on Verge of Breakdown!'' (November 2000), ventured into the more &quot;hardcore&quot; realms of S&amp;M and bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2208|title=''The Confined Bodydolls''|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001 she made ''Cos-Para'', her first video with Atlas. Among the attire Ayukawa donned in this ''cosplay'' video, was that of a nurse, a female ninja, a bunny, and [[Barbie]].&lt;ref name =&quot;COS-PARA&quot;/&gt; Her [[Alice Japan]] video ''Sexy Butt'' (June 2001) again had Ayukawa in the ''cosplay'' genre, this time in the framework of a story in which she played the role of a daydreaming office lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2029|title=''Sexy Butt''|accessdate=2007-06-24|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MAX-A chose Ayukawa to star in the first entry in their ''Witch-Hunt'' series, released in August 2001. This new video series was built around the concept of the question, &quot;Is she an angel or a witch?&quot; The quest for the answer to that question serves as a narrative framework for Ayukawa to endure torture, rape, and assorted other humiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2236|title=''The Witch-Hunt''|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back with the MAX-A label in September of 2001, Ayukawa starred in ''Sexy Widow'', in which she plays the titular character, a sex-hungry widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2239|title=''Sexy Widow''|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Splash: Wet Mermaid'' (December 2001), for the same label, has Ayukawa in the role of a mermaid seeking love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2247|title=''Splash''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the February 27, 2001 issue of the Japanese magazine ''FLASH'' surveyed the AV industry for the top 30 stars, Ayukawa was ranked number one and dubbed the &quot;Queen of AV&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosme.allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20010228A/|title=今が旬、AV界のあみ～ご|accessdate=2009-06-29|publisher=[http://cosme.allabout.co.jp/ allabout.co.jp]|date=February 28, 2001|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayukawa's &quot;long beautiful legs&quot; were the star attraction of her January 2002 Atlas release, ''Stocking Lovers''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stocking Lovers&quot;/&gt; By February of that year, Ayukawa was still being called one of the top AV idols of the time. Her video ''Legend'', while also &quot;hardcore&quot;, included documentary features of the actress talking about her AV career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=A02023|title=''LEGEND''|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English|quote=Ami Ayukawa is one of the top current AV actresses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was featured twice at [[Tokyo Topless]], Japan's longest-running and most successful big-bust website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tokyotopless.com/model/|title=Models|accessdate=2007-07-13|publisher=[[Tokyo Topless]]|language=English &amp; Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed by ''Asahi Geino'', and reprinted in an October 2001 ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'' news story on mishaps in the Japanese AV industry, Ayukawa said that her &quot;most horrific experience&quot; in the profession involved a simulated rape scene. The actress explained, &quot;During our pre-shoot meeting, the director told me he'd make sure I was all right, so I wasn't that worried. But then, suddenly, this guy grabbed me by the hair and started dragging me along the floor. Then he began choking me so hard I could barely breathe. I was almost unconscious.

{{nihongo|'''Akira Fubuki'''|風吹あきら|Fubuki Akira / Kazabuki Akira}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[AV Idol]]. Known for her &quot;light brown skin, cute nipples, and exotic face,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dressy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1073|title=''Dressy''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fubuki was &quot;a super popular AV queen&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vinfo.xcity.jp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2216|title=''Akira Fubuki DX''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan during the late 1990s.

== Career ==

Born in [[Kanagawa]] on [[March 13]], [[1978]], Akira Fubuki first became known as a [[photobook]] (or shashinshu) model. She made her photo-book debut at the age of 18 in the October 1996 release, ''Pistil''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/%30d4%30b9%30c6%30a3%30eb%2015%98a8%5439%3042%304d%3089%5199%771f%96c6/dp/4821121123/sr=1-3/qid=1157582430/ref=sr_1_3/249-2766306-2535549?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books|title=''Pistil''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://www.amazon.co.jp/ Japanese Amazon]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fubuki's AV debut was in November 1996 for the [[Alice Japan]] label.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1996.htm|title=1996|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first video for the MAX-A label was the December 1996 release, ''Dressy''&lt;ref name=&quot;Dressy&quot;/&gt; ''Pink Breath'', her second video for this label, was released in January of 1997. The nervousness of Fubuki's on-camera performance was a selling-point for this video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2216|title=''Akira Fubuki DX''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|quote=She still becomes so nervous in front of camera.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiation of a young &quot;new face&quot; AV model fits the pattern of AV career which Kjell Fornander describes. He says, &quot;Viewers are invited to follow, from appearance to appearance, her sexual initiation, dawning self-awareness and gradual acceptance of her inner, dark depths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-05-31|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|publisher=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2006-05-16|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of Fubuki's other videos have her acting in roles such as an office lady involved in a sexual relationship with her boss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1826|title=''The Lusts Of The Flesh''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a teacher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1829|title=''Immoral Lesson''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a school-girl who is raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1087|title=''Baby Oil''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her farewell to the entertainment world was with the December, 1997 photobook, ''So Long!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bookweb.kinokuniya.co.jp/guest/cgi-bin/wshoseaohb.cgi?W-NIPS=997098408X&amp;AREA=02|title=''So Long!''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[[Books Kinokuniya]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/So-Long%2015%98a8%5439%3042%304d%3089%30d5%30a1%30a4%30ca%30eb%5199%771f%96c6/dp/4821121891/sr=1-5/qid=1157582430/ref=sr_1_5/249-2766306-2535549?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books|title=''So Long!''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fubuki had become the number one AV idol,&lt;ref name=&quot;Akira Fubuki Special&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV037|title=''Akira Fubuki Special''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and retired, within a year of her AV debut. Her continued popularity inspired retrospective compilations of her works in 2000 (''Akira Fubuki Special'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Akira Fubuki Special&quot;/&gt; and 2001 (''Akira Fubuki DX'').&lt;ref name=&quot;vinfo.xcity.jp&quot;/&gt; Remaining a highly popular model to this day, her products continue to be widely available through video and [[VCD|Video CD]] outlets specializing in Asian video products, as well as the Japanese website of the mainstream, global outlet [[Amazon.com]], and the Japanese bookstore chain, [[Books Kinokuniya|Kinokuniya]].

==Questions of rape==

Of note is a video circulating various download programs claiming that the actress contained in the movie is Akira Fubuki as she is raped by two male porn stars. When one compares the video to known pictures of her, however, the link is clearly false. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
The clip makes use of [[pixelization]], a genital obscuring technique Japanese pornographers are required to use before a video can be legally sold in Japan. This would suggest that regardless of the identity of the actress, the &quot;rape&quot; is not real, but a rape fantasy intended for legal sale in Japan.

The actual actress that appears in that video is in fact Japanese porn star [[Sally Yoshino]].

{{nihongo|'''Mai Haruna'''|春菜まい|Haruna Mai}} is a popular and prolific [[Japan]]ese [[Model (person)|model]] and [[AV idol]]. She debuted in 2002 and performed in a variety of Japanese adult video genres until her retirement in 2005.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Tokyo]] on March 20, 1984, Mai Haruna's [[Chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] ([[adult video]]) career focuses her large bust. Until Haruna's generation, the women in her family were of a thin build. Both her mother and grandmother were thin, and Haruna and her older sister were the first in the family to have large breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b-v.co.jp/back-number/203/harunamai-ran.html|title={{nihongo2|春菜まいのランジェリ}}ー  (Haruna Mai no Ranjerii) Video Idol Interview|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=www.b-v.co.jp|language=Japanese|quote={{nihongo2|うちの家系はみんな細い。私とお姉ちゃんだけがなぜか胸が大きいの。... おばあちゃんも細い。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haruna's bust developed early, beginning before her entrance into junior high school. By her third year in junior high school, she was already a metric F-cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b-v.co.jp/back-number/203/harunamai-ran.html|title={{nihongo2|春菜まいのランジェリー}}  (Haruna Mai no Ranjerii) Video Idol Interview|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=www.b-v.co.jp|language=Japanese|quote={{nihongo2|中学に入った頃から大きくなって中3ではFカップあった}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV Career===
Haruna made her AV debut at the age of 18, in September 2002, for the [[Crystal-Eizou]] company.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2002.htm|title=2002|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year she appeared in the [[English language|English]]-titled ''HOLIDAYS'', the first of her many photo books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/HOLIDAYS%E2%80%95%E6%98%A5%E8%8F%9C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%84%E5%86%99%E7%9C%9F%E9%9B%86-%E8%97%A4%E7%94%B0-%E5%81%A5%E4%BA%94/dp/4754215435/ref=sr_1_1/250-3902396-1920202?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1177779432&amp;sr=1-1|title=HOLIDAYS―{{nihongo2|春菜まい写真集 (大型本)}}|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=www.amazon.co.jp|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haruna's &quot;cute face&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD314|title=''Mai Haruna Collection''|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (metric) &quot;H-cup dynamite breasts&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Extreme Service Brothel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD264|title=''Mai Haruna in Extreme Service Brothel''|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; have helped make her a popular and busy actress in Japanese adult videos. As one indication of her prolific output, Japanese Amazon currently lists 185 DVDs, 28 videos and 7 books in which Haruna appears.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Amazon search: {{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/s?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%8Ft%8D%D8%82%DC%82%A2|title={{nihongo2|春菜まい}} (Haruna Mai)|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=www.amazon.co.jp|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her busy three-year stint makes Haruna stand out in the Japanese AV field, where an average career spans about a year, with five to ten videos total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-04-28|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|publisher=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate =2007-03-20|quote=If she’s only out for money, she will studiously avoid publicity and quit inside a year-the average life-span of an AV girl-with five or ten videos to her credit and an unknowing family bosom to return to.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haruna was honored at the 4th annual [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#4th Takeshi Kitano Awards (2003)|Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards]] for 2003 sponsored by the Japanese tabloid newspaper ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' (東京スポーツ), where she won the Leading AV Actress Award (主演AV女優賞).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/tsmp/movie.htm

Haruna has worked in various genres of the Japanese AV including [[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]], [[Orgy|orgies]] and [[urolagnia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIP249|title=''Sin and Punishment''|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her December 2004 video, ''Suppin''' follows the classic Japanese AV mock-documentary format pioneered by early AV innovator, [[Toru Muranishi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=Chapter 18 (Naked Dissent)|quote=Sometimes the documentary is faked, predictably with sadistic themes, which nonetheless strive to maintain a spontaneous veneer...

===Retirement &amp; Uncensored Videos===
Haruna made a number of videos with AV studio [[Moodyz]] and she retired from AV work with an August 2005 video for them, ''Moodyz Special Mai Haruna - Mai Last Movie'', a 3 hour roundup of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moodyz.com/shop/-/detail/=/cid=mdl459/|title=MOODYZ春菜まいスペシャル|accessdate=2008-11-03|publisher=[http://www.moodyz.com/ Moodyz]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compilations of material from earlier in her career still appear including the 2007 video, ''A Band of Nasty AV Actresses''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD362|title=''A Band of Nasty AV Actresses''|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the humiliation genre for which her physical attributes have been previously singled out for praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD271|title=''Sin and Punishment Perfect Collection / Mai Haruna''|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English|quote=The hard punishments make her G-cup tits shake so well!!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other AV Idols, after leaving mainstream Japanese porn Haruna made some &quot;uncensored&quot; movies without the mosaic pixelation used to obscure the genitals in legal Japanese adult videos. Uncensored videos are available online or are sold as DVDs internationally or in underground (&quot;[[urabon]]&quot;) outlets in Japan. She appeared in three pay-per-view online videos released in July and December 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ppv.xvn.eu/en/list/actor/all/publishdate/picturecomment/10/0/203|title=Title List&gt; Mai Haruna|accessdate=2008-11-03|publisher=[http://ppv.xvn.eu/en/ ppv.xvn.eu/en]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in two uncensored DVDs released in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.xvn.eu/en/list/actor/all/publishdate/picturecomment/10/0/203|title=List View&gt; Mai Haruna|accessdate=2008-11-03|publisher=[http://dvd.xvn.eu/en/ dvd.xvn.eu/en]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jō was born in Tokyo and was a TV commercial model before starting a career in pornography.&lt;ref name=&quot;No Cut 4 Hours&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV183|title=''No Cut 4 Hours　Asami Jo''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Japanese AVs involve some form of documentary style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schönherr|first=Johannes|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/company-matsuo-and-the-world-of-japanese-adult-video.shtml|title=Japanese AV - A Short Introduction|date=December 29, 2006|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com Midnight Eye]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asami Jō's videos, however, are mainly in the fictional style of the ''[[pink film]]'' and early AV.&lt;ref&gt;Schönherr. &quot;These films, even though shot on video, just continued the pink film tradition and adhered to the pink film rules and limitations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

She debuted with the [[Alice Japan]] label in October 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1995.htm|title=1995|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her February 1996 release for the same label, ''Love Potion'', told the story of a woman (Jō) who supports her boyfriend financially while he is studying to become a lawyer. She employs sex as a means to make cosmetic sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1778|title=''Love Potion''|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thrilling Club: A Scandalous Night With You'' (April 1996), had Jō as a married woman who meets an old classmate, with whom she and her husband engage in a menage-a-trois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1786|title=''Thrilling Club''|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Beautiful Slave'' (May 1996), she played the role of a young woman who is unhappy with the marriage her parents have arranged for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1789|title=''The Beautiful Slave''|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Obscene Model'' (June 1996) had Jō in the role of a woman who acts like a cat in heat. When she is taken to a veterinarian, she engages in animalistic sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1794|title=''Obscene Model''|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Top Secret Is Full Nude'', released in July 1996, she played a woman who is raped by a man who is later hired by her husband, for whose company she also works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1798|title=''Top Secret Is Full Nude''|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Almost Broken'' was an organized crime melodrama with Jō escaping from a gang and becoming involved in telephone sex. Like the previously-described videos, this August 1996 release was an [[Alice Japan]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1802|title=''Almost Broken''|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asami Jō later appeared in such mainstream TV series as ''Weatherwoman 2'' (1996) and ''[[Denji Sentai Megaranger]]'' (1997) [http://www.qzc.co.jp/DORAMA_CGI/DORAMA1.exe?AFLG=&amp;TARGET1=TITLE%2CNAME&amp;KEY1=&amp;MODE1=SYNONYM&amp;TARGET2=CAST&amp;KEY2=%8F%E9%96%83%94%FC&amp;MODE2=SYNONYM&amp;TARGET3=ENSHUTSU%2CPRODUCER%2CKIKAKU%2CSEISAKU%2CKYAKUHON%2CGENSAKU%2CART%2CTECNIQUE&amp;KEY3=&amp;MODE3=SYNONYM&amp;TARGET4=ETC&amp;KEY4=&amp;MODE4=SYNONYM&amp;TARGET5=GENSAKU&amp;KEY5=&amp;MODE5=SYNONYM&amp;CHK=AND&amp;ACTION=%8C%9F%8D%F5%82%F0%82%B7%82%E9] She became a TV commentator,&lt;ref name=&quot;No Cut 4 Hours&quot;/&gt; and from 1995-1998 she was a regular on the nighttime TV show ''[[Gilgamesh Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186748/fullcredits|title=Full cast and crew for &quot;Gilgamesh Night&quot;|accessdate=2007-07-17|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Bunko Kanazawa'''|金沢文子|Kanazawa Bunko}} is a prolific and well-known [[Japanese pornography|Japanese adult film]] actress, who has been called &quot;one of the biggest [[AV idol]]s in Japan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanazawa_jmate_interview_10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_10.html|title=A nice chat with one of the biggest AV-idols in Japan (Interview)|accessdate=2007-02-21 |language=English|publisher=www.jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life and career==
==Debut==
Born [[April 4]], [[1979]] in [[Kanagawa prefecture]]), as a child Bunko Kanazawa was good at [[mathematics]] and [[science]], but horrible in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[English language|English]] studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanazawa_jmate_interview_54&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_54.html|title=Kanazawa Bunko Interview|accessdate=2007-04-21|language=English|publisher=www.jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hobbies as an adult include [[cooking]], [[snowboarding]] and [[karaoke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;avidol-profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=492|title=Bunko (Kanazawa Bunko)|accessdate=2007-04-21|language=English||publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanazawa was introduced to the AV industry by a friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanazawa_jmate_interview_10&quot;/&gt; Her stage name, given to her by her agency, is taken from [[Kanazawa Bunko]], a train station, museum and historic library in Kanagawa Prefecture, where she lived at the start of her career. Her stage name is sometimes shortened to &quot;Kanabun&quot;, a nickname which Kanazawa dislikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanazawa_jmate_interview_10&quot;/&gt; Kanazawa made her AV (adult video) debut with the Cosmos Plan label in the August 1997 release ''18 Years Old''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1997.htm|title=1997|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanazawa's second video, ''Tough Adolescence'', was a science-fiction sex drama released by the same label in September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IM78|title=''Tough Adolescence''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MDS004|title=''Tough Adolescence''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of videos such as this one, which required a degree of acting, Kanazawa commented that she does not consider herself a good actress. She says that she especially has difficulty with a leading role and with adlibbing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanazawa_jmate_interview_54&quot;/&gt; ''Obscene Model'' (August 1999) was another video in which Kanazawa had to use her acting abilities. She played the role of a [[race queen]] who seduces her sponsor and her cameraman. This video also included a scene in which the actress visits a man's home—an amateur—and performs for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1938|title=''Obscene Model''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanazawa was still with the Cosmos Plan label for her one-year anniversary video, ''Platinum Fuck'' (September 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IH31|title=''Platinum FUCK''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VCDs and DVDs==
In addition to videos and DVDs, Kanazawa released several works in the [[Video CD|VCD]] format. She initiated a four-volume &quot;Special Edition&quot; VCD set in December 1997. All of these releases contained selections from Kanazawa's videos and images in the [[Bitmap Image|.BMP]] format. The first VCD ''SUPER BEST'' in this series had highlights of Kanazawa's debut and scenes from ''Tough Adolescence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MVC019|title=''SUPER BEST''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second &quot;Special Edition&quot; VCD, ''Kanabun's Feel'', released in May 1998, was a similar collection of scenes from three of Kanazawa's previous releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MVC024|title=''Kanabun's feel''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Special Edition&quot; series continued in September 1998 with the release of ''Kanabun Typhoon Going North'', which had highlights from four of her videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MVC028|title=''Kanabun Typhoon Going North''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth volume in the series was released one year later, in September 1999, due to popular demand. This one also featured highlights from four previously released videos, as well as behind-the-scenes images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MVC045|title=''Bunko Kanazawa Best 4''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanazawa's first DVD release was a reissue of her debut video. Much was made of the visual clarity of the still new medium in advertising the release. It was claimed that the picture was so clear, Kanazawa's pubic hair (the display of which was banned by Japanese censorship laws), could be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MDS002|title=''18 Years Old''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fetish videos==
Kanazawa has also appeared in several [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] films focusing on particular sub-genres of the AV industry. Her January 1999 entry in [[Alice Japan]]'s popular {{nihongo|''Female Ass''|女尻|Meijiri}} series focuses on various manipulations of the actress's posterior, and includes scenes with panties and lotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1912|title=''Female Ass''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV010|title=''Female Ass'' (DVD)|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inhumanity'' focused on sexual violence, with the actress beaten up, raped and forced to perform fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV024|title=''Inhumanity'' (DVD)|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max-A's ''Erotic Opening'' series, which focuses on fellatio, featured Kanazawa in its March 1999 video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2162|title=''Erotic Opening''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fetish Virgin III'' had the camera fetishistically centering on individual parts of the actress's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2164|title=''Fetish Virgin III''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-titled DVD from September 1999 was a similar work for body-part fetishists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XV003|title=''Bunko Kanazawa''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1999, Max-A chose to star Bunko Kanazawa in the first video in the revival of its popular ''Confined Bodydolls''. Entitled ''The Confined Bodydolls: Bunko Goes Wild'' the video had Kanazawa in bondage on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2171|title=''The Confined Bodydolls''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In magazine shoots, Kanazawa often appears dressed as a [[schoolgirl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanazawa_jmate_interview_10&quot;/&gt; Her first video to make use of this common theme in Japanese erotica was ''Uniform Indecent Doctrine'', released in October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IH35|title=''Uniform Indecent Doctrine''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her appearance in Atlas's popular ''NEO Bloody Uniform Connection'' series—the 51st video in that series—again had Kanazawa in the uniform of a high school girl. In addition, this ''[[cosplay]]''-themed video had Kanazawa wearing the costumes of a nurse, an elevator girl, and a policewoman in a miniskirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=9A054|title=''NEO Bloody Uniform Connection 51''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autobiographical videos==
''Legend Of An AV Idol'' (February 1999) was Kanazawa's first video for Atlas. This release focused on Kanazawa's career and stories of how she reached the number one spot in the Japanese AV industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=9A022|title=''Legend Of An AV Idol''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Alice Japan]], Kanazawa made a two-volume ''Self-Portrait'' series. These videos had the actress photographing herself in private moments, and engaging in sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1922|title=''Self-Portrait #2''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DC074|title=''Self-Portrait #2'' (VCD)|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Kanazawa's career was the subject of a five-volume retrospective &quot;Memorial&quot; series from Cosmos Plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;avidol-profile&quot;/&gt;

Though Kanazawa dislikes airplane travel, she enjoys filming in overseas locations such as [[Bali]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanazawa_jmate_interview_54&quot;/&gt; Her July 1998 release, ''Misfire Erotica'', was filmed in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IH20|title=''Misfire Erotica''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Later career==
In 2003, Kanazawa began a series of videos for [[Moodyz]] which included a December 2004 [[gokkun]] title, ''Bunko Kanazawa Drink Sperm Too''. After a January 2005 simulated rape video (''Bunko Kanazawa Will be Violated'') for Moodyz, Kanazawa announced her retirement from the AV industry, although she continued working as a stripteaser.&lt;ref name=&quot;sweatpig&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweatpig.com/bunko-kanazawa-returns-to-jav/.|title=Bunko Kanazawa Returns to JAV |accessdate=2008-07-30|publisher=[http://www.sweatpig.com/ www.sweatpig.com]|date=November 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported in 2006 that Kanazawa would start making uncensored movies for a studio/website called Tora Tora Tora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www16.suppa.jp/toratoratora.html|title=大物AV女優がたくさんTORATORATORA・虎虎虎.紹介ページ (Many great AV actresses/Tora Tora Tora page)|accessdate=2007-08-02|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://www16.suppa.jp/ www16.suppa.jp]|quote=金沢文子、鈴木麻奈美、灘ジュンをはじめとする大物AV女優は勿論...}}&lt;/ref&gt; These began to appear in September 2006 as pay-per-view videos on the 99b.com website and then later on XVN.JP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ppv.xvn.jp/ja/list/actor/all/publishdate/picturecomment/10/0/3147|title=全作品一覧&gt; 金沢文子 (Bunko Kanazawa Complete Works PPV|accessdate=2008-11-02|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://ppv.xvn.jp/ ppv.xvn.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the material has been collected in two DVDs released in March 2007 and May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.xvn.jp/ja/list/actor/all/publishdate/picturecomment/10/0/3147|title=全作品一覧&gt; 金沢文子 (Bunko Kanazawa Complete Works DVD|accessdate=2008-11-02|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://dvd.xvn.jp/ dvd.xvn.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost 3 years away from the mainstream Japanese porn scene, Kanazawa made a comeback in December 2007 with a new video for Moodyz (''Hyper-Digital Mosaic Vol.072'') and one in January 2008 for Das (''Semen Urine Human Toilet'').&lt;ref name=&quot;sweatpig&quot;/&gt; She has continued her career through 2008 including a series for [[Attackers]] with director Kenzo Nagira and the [[AV Grand Prix]] entry for the new studio Ran Maru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ran-maru.com/works/avgl/avgl149.html|title=中にあたるとオカチクなっちゃう！|accessdate=2008-11-02|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://www.ran-maru.com/ www.ran-maru.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikuchi's theatrical film debut was with Million Films in their {{nihongo|''Miss 20 Year-Old Momoko''|ミス２０才　快感！百合子の本番}} in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0072490.htm|title={{nihongo2|菊池えり}} (Kikuchi Eri)|publisher=[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/ JMDB]|accessdate=2009-07-03|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August of the same year, she starred in Shintoho's theatrical ''pink film'', {{nihongo|''Eri Kikuchi: Big Tits''|菊池エリ　巨乳|Kikuchi Eri Kyonyu}}.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JMDB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0072490.htm|title={{nihongo2|菊池えり}} (Kikuchi Eri)|accessdate=2007-03-19|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film has Kikuchi playing &quot;Eri,&quot; a nude model and AV actress who becomes romantically involved with her manager.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shin-Toho&quot;/&gt; 
In 1988 she starred in one of Nikkatsu's last ''Roman Porno'' films, {{nihongo|''Eri Kikuchi: Big Tits Blame''|菊池エリ　巨乳責め|Kikuchi Eri: Kyonyuzeme}}, and in 1993 she would star in another theatrical Big-Bust title ({{nihongo2|巨乳熟女　本番仕込み}}), for Excess Films, Nikkatsu's post-''Roman Porno'' line of theatrical softcore pornography.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMDB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-02-19|last=Domenig|first=Roland|date= |year=2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041118094603/http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|archivedate=2004-11-18|quote=Excess is an offshoot of Nikkatsu, established in 1988 when Nikkatsu ended Roman Porno production.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kikuchi spent some time in Guam with her husband, a foreign (i.e., non-Japanese) dancer. Here she put her AV work on hold for a while, and worked mainly as a stripper. Kikuchi later returned to Japan and the AV industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/菊池えり|title={{nihongo2|菊池えり}} (Kikuchi Eri)|accessdate=2007-05-12|publisher=Japanese Wikipedia|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, she was working as a lecturer/demonstrator at the AV Cultures School, a school started by male AV actor, Shinji Kubo, to train future AV directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/06/20030611p2g00m0dm999000c.html|title=Adult video veteran turns porn pedant for new stick flick school|accessdate=2007-05-12|date=2003-06-11|publisher=''Mainichi Shimbun''|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 2004 Kikuchi, aged 39, had returned to AV with a series of videos for [[Madonna (studio)|Madonna]], a studio specializing in &quot;mature&quot; actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madonna-av.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=128/|title=菊池エリ きくちえり）(Eri Kikuchi Profile)|publisher=[http://www.madonna-av.com/ www.madonna-av.com]|accessdate=2009-07-03|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her recent videos for the CineMagic company are in their popular &quot;mourning&quot; series which feature a &quot;beautiful woman wearing... solemn mourning [attire] with a mouth-gag,&quot; and &quot;[fetishism] and eroticism with a mourning-clad woman tied up with hemp ropes&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sex Slave in Mourning&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DD226|title=''Sex Slave in Mourning''|accessdate=2007-05-12|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kikuchi's performances for CineMagic were included in their compilation video of April, 2006, ''Best of Collect: Battered Angels '05'', which included the new big-bust actress Alice Hoshi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best of Collect: Battered Angels '05&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DVS051|title=''Best of Collect: Battered Angels '05''|accessdate=2007-05-12|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
According to her official profile, Hitomi Kobayashi was born {{nihongo|Yukari Ishii|石井ゆかり|Ishii Yukari}} in [[Tokyo]] on [[September 2]], [[1965]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AVIdol&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=408|title=Hitomi (Hitomi Kobayashi)|accessdate=2007-03-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview in the {{nihongo|''Weekly Post''|週刊ポスト}} just before her retirement in 2003, she confessed to have actually been born in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japanese Wiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/小林ひとみ|title={{nihongo2|小林ひとみ}} (Kobayashi Hitomi)|accessdate=2007-03-19|publisher=[[Japanese Wikipedia]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ambition since childhood was to be an actress. She attended acting school, and registered with a talent agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt; Kobayashi was not particularly sexually precocious, claiming at the time of her AV debut, &quot;I lost my virginity at 18, which is probably a bit late, and I wasn't very experienced with men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt;

This relative sexual conservatism extended into her AV career. The sex scenes in all but her final video were simulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Legs open way to 6 billion yen career|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/12/20031213p2g00m0dm999000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060107142509/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/12/20031213p2g00m0dm999000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[December 13]], [[2003]]|archivedate=2006-01-07|accessdate=2007-10-09|quote=I finally agreed to appear, but as long as the sex was only simulated. That's how my stance on never going all the way on film started.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even at the end of her AV career, Kobayashi's attitude towards sex remained modest. Interviewed at the time of her retirement, Kobayashi said, &quot;I love sex. But, just because I'm an AV actress, it doesn't mean I'm brim-filled with experience. I've done orgy movies, and lesbian scenes and loads of abnormal stuff, but the world of videos isn't a real world. My normal life is really plain. I couldn't imagine having sex anywhere other than in bed and taking part in an orgy would be unthinkable. I'm happy enough with just the missionary position.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt;

Kobayashi made her debut using the stage name {{nihongo|Kaori Matsumoto|松本かおり|Matsumoto Kaori}} in May 1986 in a [[photobook]] and &quot;image video&quot; both titled {{nihongo|''Pounding: 19-year-old Kaori''|ときめき・かおり19歳|Tokimeki: Kaori Jukyusai''}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;/&gt; However, in spite of these two releases, she believed her career was going nowhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut===
Not long after her debut in the non-pornographic media, Kobayashi was presented with a new opportunity. She says, &quot;I got this offer to do a movie called ''Kinjirareta Kankei (Forbidden Relationship)''. I was told there were nude and love scenes, but nothing steamier than any ordinary movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt; Shocked when she found out this was actually an adult video, she was at first reluctant. After a long discussion with her agent she finally agreed to perform in the video only if the sex was simulated. She changed her stage name to Hitomi Kobayashi for the video which was a surprise success, selling 50,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt; Her amazing popularity quickly made her the leading AV actress of the mid-1980s, and, not long after her debut, she had earned the title &quot;AV Queen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mainichi-AV-queen&quot;/&gt; 

Japan's censorship laws prevent the display of the sexual organs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schönherr|first=Johannes|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/company-matsuo-and-the-world-of-japanese-adult-video.shtml|title=Japanese AV - A Short Introduction|date=[[December 29]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com Midnight Eye]|quote=...Japanese porn has the problem that no genitals can be seen in the videos. They are all hidden behind pixels...}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Kobayashi to maintain her insistence on performing only simulated sex on camera throughout her AV career. Kobayashi considered her AV performances to be another form of acting and came up with various techniques for appearing to have actual sex. For example, she says, &quot;I used to get the directors to tickle my feet and then tried not to laugh so it looked as though I was climaxing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt;

Her career was put in danger when an uncensored bootleg copy of one of her videos circulated. When it could be plainly seen that the &quot;AV Queen&quot; was not performing real sex, Kobayashi feared that her fans would abandon her. These fears proved to be groundless, however, and her popularity continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt;

===Theatrical career===
By 1987, Kobayashi's popularity had already earned her the title &quot;Queen of AV&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-222&quot;/&gt; [[Nikkatsu]], which had been the leader of Japanese theatrical pornography since the inception of its ''[[Roman Porno]]'' series in 1971, was rapidly losing its audience to the AV industry. Though the studio had publicly condemned the AVs for years, in an attempt to lure some of Kobayashi's AV fans into the theater, Nikkatsu hired the AV Queen to star in her own series of films. The first of these, {{nihongo|''Hitomi Kobayashi's Secret Pleasure''|小林ひとみ 奥戯快感　艶|Kobayashi Hitomi ougi kaikan: tsuya}} was released in January 1987. Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser, in their ''Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films'', judge the film as &quot;little more than a Playboy or Penthouse lingerie special.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-222&quot;/&gt; 
[[Image:Hitomi Kobayashi Hard Petting.jpg|left|''Hitomi Kobayashi's Heavy Petting'']]
The second, {{nihongo|''Hitomi Kobayashi's Heavy Petting''|ハード・ペッティング|Hard Petting}}, released in March 1987, was part of Nikkatsu's new &quot;Roman X&quot; line, which was purportedly more &quot;hardcore&quot; than the standard ''Roman Porno''. However, Japan's practice of censorship by fogging out genitals made this move into &quot;hardcore&quot; rather pointless, since, as [[Donald Richie]] put it in his pioneering essay on the ''Pink film'', &quot;none of the working parts are ever shown.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richie|first=Donald|title=A Lateral View: Essays on Culture and Style in Contemporary Japan|origyear=1972|year=1992|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn= |pages=156-169|chapter=The Japanese Eroduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these first two films were judged little more than AVs on film, and were not popular with either AV fans or the critics, who preferred Nikkatsu's older ''Roman Porno'' style. 
[[Image:Hitomi Kobayashi Young Girl Story.jpg|right|''Hitomi Kobayashi's Young Girl Story'']]
The third in this series, {{nihongo|''Hitomi Kobayashi's Young Girl Story''|小林ひとみの令嬢物語|Kobayashi Hitomi no reijo monogatari}} (released [[December 19]], [[1987]]), came closest to the old Nikkatsu style, in that it had some semblance of a plot,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-222&quot;/&gt; but by now it was too late for the studio. It would cease production of ''Roman Porno'' in 1988, and declare bankruptcy in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macias|first=Patrick|title=TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion|year=2001|publisher=Cadence Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-56931-681-3|pages=187-188|chapter=Nikkatsu's Roman Porno}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the height of her popularity, in 1987, Kobayashi married Toshifumi Yuzawa, who would later become the president of Kobayashi's talent agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flop&quot;/&gt; Kobayashi put her AV performances on hold for a few years beginning in 1989 to concentrate on family matters. During this period, she never officially retired, never completely ceased appearing in AVs, and worked occasionally as a stripper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japanese Wiki&quot;/&gt;  In 1988 she had a major role in the mainstream {{nihongo|''[[Evil Dead Trap]]''|死霊の罠 |Shiryo no wana}}. [[Allmovie]] describes the film as a &quot;sickening but riveting slasher,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG-Evil Dead&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:161835|first=Robert|last=Firsching|title=''Evil Dead Trap''|accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=[[Allmovie]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author and film critic Patrick Galloway calls the film, &quot;...nothing short of a multicultural terror tour de force, featuring gruesome, brilliantly rendered sound and imagery that will stay with you to your last dying gasp.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galloway|first=Patrick|title=Asia Shock: Horror and Dark Cinema from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Thailand|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=1-933330-12-0|pages=165|chapter=Evil Dead Trap: Shiryo no wana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written by [[Takashi Ishii]] and directed by [[Toshiharu Ikeda]], the film inspired two sequels.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG-Evil Dead&quot;/&gt; [[Japan Home Video]], which financed the film, wished to showcase Kobayashi, their top AV star at the time, as the star of the film. Director Ikeda, unsure of Kobayashi's acting abilities, instead put [[Miyuki Ono]] in the lead role of Nami, and gave Kobabayashi the supporting role of Rei. The near adult-video style sex scenes that Kobayashi performs in the film have been criticized by [[horror film]] purists as the element that prevents the film from attaining genre classic status. Galloway, however, points out that ''Evil Dead Trap'' is not pure horror, but a genre-transcending film. About the sex scenes, Galloway comments, &quot;Ikeda handles the steamy segments like a pro, coming as he did from [[Nikkatsu]], where he honed his craft making the studio's signature ''[[List of Nikkatsu Roman Porno films|roman porno]]'' (romantic pornography).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, p.168.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 and 1997 Hitomi Kobayashi starred in two films for pioneering ''pink film'' director Satoru Kobayashi, director of ''Flesh Market'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]) the first ''pink film''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0181230.htm|title={{nihongo2|小林悟}} (Kobayashi Satoru)|accessdate=2007-10-09|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]|}} ({{nihongo2|小林ひとみ　男狂い有閑マダム}}, released [[1996-07-22]] and {{nihongo2|小林ひとみの快楽熟女とろける}}, released [[1997-07-14]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 she played the somewhat autobiographical role of fictional AV actress Mizuki Mahoro in the 1997 [[V-cinema]] film {{nihongo|''Destroying Mosaic''|モザイク崩し}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kobayashi-JMDB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0180630.htm|title={{nihongo2|小林ひとみ}} (Kobayashi Hitomi)|accessdate=2007-03-19|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobayashi's official return to the AV industry was in the November 1998 video ''Love Bond'' or ''Immoral Bonds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT360|title=''Immoral Baptism''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|quote=She made a come back in November with ''Love Bond''...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Over ten years after her debut, Kobayashi was by now a &quot;mature woman&quot; model, and her videos began to reflect the new niche for mature models in AVs which began to appear in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/S_SHINOZAKI/index.html|title=Satomi Shinozaki biography|accessdate=2007-02-18|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/ Shin-Toho History]|quote=...since the middle of '90s when mature women started getting popular in porn movies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her June 1999 release, ''Madame Throat'' ventured into the incest genre.

In an industry in which the average career spans only a year and produces five to ten videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-05-12|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|publisher=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2007-03-20|quote=If she’s only out for money, she will studiously avoid publicity and quit inside a year-the average life-span of an AV girl-with five or ten videos to her credit...}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2003, Kobayashi had worked in the AV field for over a decade and a half and appeared in about 70 films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt; The 39 AVs in which she had starred had sold over 600,000 copies, earning about 6 billion yen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang&quot;/&gt; Reflecting on her Adult Video career at this time, Kobayashi commented, &quot;I'm delighted to have led a career where I would be elevated to being called 'AV Queen,' as well as to have lasted in the business until I turned 40.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Legs open way&quot;/&gt;

Wishing to retire on a high-note, Kobayashi and her manager/husband advertised for investors in one last, 2-volume, two-and-a-half-hour AV opus. Kobayashi sought 35 investors who would contribute 500,000 yen each, for the privilege of a dinner with Kobayashi, having their names listed in the video's credits, and an exclusive viewing of the video.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bang&quot;/&gt; The video was released in two volumes as ''Hitomi Kobayashi FINAL - Disc1'' ([[December 19]], [[2003]]) and ''Disc2'' ([[December 31]], [[2003]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AVIdol&quot;/&gt; The first half of the work was subtitled ''Nostalgic'', and contained highlights from videos made during the early part of her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD224|title=''Hitomi Kobayashi FINAL　Disc1: Nostalgic''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume of the set, subtitled ''Love'', was promoted as containing Kobayashi's first and last on-screen real sex scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD225|title=''Hitomi Kobayashi FINAL　Disc2: LOVE''|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Hitomi Kobayashi Final 2.jpg|thumb|100px|right|''Hitomi Kobayashi Final: Volume 2'']]
Controversy followed in the wake of the release when some of the investors in the video reported they were promised dividends from their investment, but had received none. It was claimed that Kobayashi had got over 50 investors for the project, but that her husband had used the money to pay personal debt and for recreational activities unrelated to the film. Insufficient communication with the investors, the shutting down of the film's website, the company repeatedly changing its name, and changing reports on whether or not the film made a profit added to investor complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flop&quot;/&gt; In 2004, Kobayashi was reported working as a hostess at her nightclub in [[Roppongi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flop&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kaoru Kuroki'''|黒木香|Kuroki Kaoru}}, is one of [[Japan]]'s best-known AV, or [[adult video]] performers, and a multi-media personality whose role as a media counselor expressing outspoken views on sex and society have drawn comparisons to [[Ilona Staller|La Cicciolina]] and [[Ruth Westheimer|Dr. Ruth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=Bye-Bye Pink Cinema, Hello Adult Video|page=613}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Life and career ==
=== Early life ===
Kaoru Kuroki (whose stage name translates to &quot;Blackwood Fragrance&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Bornoff, p.416.&lt;/ref&gt; was born [[January 21]], [[1965]] to a conservative, comfortably middle-class family. The daughter of an engineer, Kuroki was a naturally gifted child and showed artistic talent from an early age. She left public school at the age of 15 to attend art college, and later studied Renaissance art history at Yokohama National University.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fornander&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-04-25|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|publisher=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2006-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bornoff, p.610&lt;/ref&gt;

While still attending [[Yokohama National University]], Kuroki began appearing in AVs, at first considering this to be another form of art. &quot;I wanted to approach it purely as a performance art form, but it turned out to be a lot crazier than that. In fact, if I'd continued to see porno video as art without also acknowledging it as just a fuck film, I wouldn't have gone this far.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bornoff, p.616, 618 (Quotes from Kaoru Kuroki are from interviews conducted by Nicholas Bornoff)&lt;/ref&gt;

She expresses admiration for the films of [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], but, while she continues to view her AV performances as a social mission, she contrasts the AV with film. She says the AV &quot;has a different atmosphere. It's not very sophisticated, in fact it's primitive. It's a bit like eating and menus in restaurants: you're hungry and you have a sudden craving for noodles, so you go and eat noodles. Your appetite is towards a porno video, so you go and rent whatever turns you on. And as with food, viewers can use basic ingredients to 'cook' the desired stimulation from the video themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bornoff, p.611, 614, 616&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AV debut ===
Kuroki's adult video debut was on October 2, 1986 at the major AV company [[Crystal-Eizou]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1986.htm|title=1986|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the innovative AV director and former porn actor, Toru Muranishi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fornander&quot;/&gt; Muranishi was the creator of the documentary style often emulated in Japanese AVs. Kuroki, sharing Muranishi's opinion that the AV should have a documentary quality, moved with him when he founded his own company, Diamond Visual. Kuroki's AVs for Muranishi usually began with her seated, sharply dressed, and addressing the camera in an improvised talk on a subject like sexual liberation. This would typically be followed by a modeling segment, either nude or in a swimsuit. The remaining video footage would be taken up with various sexual performances, often involving [[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornoff, p.610-611&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the sex scenes, Bornoff states, &quot;the peripherals in a Kuroki video are fairly violent stuff. She oscillates between abused sexual slave and the epitome of self-assertion with schizophrenic rapidity. To some, the documentary makes for a jarring experience; the feedback she gets from viewers can be surprising. Some say they almost find her frightening; that they can't get a hard-on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornoff-617&quot;&gt;Bornoff, p.617&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuroki responds, &quot;The men who find my videos frightening often recognize the wilder, more uninhibited side of their own girlfriends. In order to liberate themselves, they must first take off their armour. If a man recognizes Kuroki in his wife or girlfriend, he is forced to strip it off in order to deal with her. That's how I liberate both sexes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bornoff, p.618&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mainstream breakthrough ===
Kuroki was engaged in video and magazine appearances typical to being an AV model when she caught the attention of the mainstream media in 1988. Her decision to stop shaving her under-arm hair, as a symbolic protest against Japan's long-standing censorship of the depiction of pubic hair in print or film, gained Kuroki interviews with the mainstream media. Kuroki concedes that her decision to stop shaving her under-arms worked as a gimmick to help set her apart from the mass of AV girls, but considers it also an expression of femininity and identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornoff-612&quot;&gt;Bornoff, p.612&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by her ability to speak intelligently and matter-of-factly about subjects normally considered unmentionable, late-night talk shows began inviting Kuroki as a guest. Soon she had become a popular daytime TV panellist, was appearing in commercials, and served as a large department store's campaign girl. While she was popular with her male audience for her AV appearances, she also appealed to a female audience by expressing feminist view on daytime television.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iwamura&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/7.2/Iwamura.html|title=Letter from Japan: From Girls Who Dress Up Like Boys To Trussed-up Porn Stars - Some of the Contemporary Heroines on the Japanese Screen|accessdate=2007-04-25 |last=Iwamura|first=Rosemary|year=1994|publisher=Continuum: The Australian Journal of Media &amp; Culture, vol. 7 no. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on her popularity, unprecedented for an AV model up to that time, Kuroki points out that there was a social need for someone like her. &quot;I talk about life as a woman, but with my background, obviously the focus is on sex. I seem to have become a spokeswoman for the too many women who are embarrassed to talk about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornoff-612&quot;/&gt;

In 1988 Kuroki visited [[Italy]] where she met [[Cicciolina]], whom she regards as ''[[sensei]]''. She was pleased to find that many of their opinions coincided, but was surprised by [[Cicciolina]]'s discomfort with Kuroki's masochistic tendencies and preference for the S&amp;M genre. Kuroki attributes this to cultural and personal differences, and does not feel that S&amp;M equates to submissiveness. Indeed, Fornander points out that Kuroki made AVs in general, and S&amp;M in particular a feminist issue in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fornander&quot;/&gt;

In 1989, Kuroki appeared with the new AV star and fellow Diamond Visual employee, [[Kimiko Matsuzaka]] in her second AV. In two entries of Diamond's later ''How to Sex - Sexual Information'' series of instructional sex videos, Kuroki served as the instructor/lecturer with Matsuzaka performing the physical demonstrations. After Matsuzaka's retirement from AV appearances in 1990, Kuroki also appeared with Matsuzaka at the [[Akasaka]] club, &quot;Mirukuhooru&quot; (&quot;Milk Hall&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adachi|first=Noriyuki|title=アダルトな人びと - Adaruto na Hitobito (&quot;Adult&quot; People)|publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|language=Japanese|isbn=4-06-205546-5|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and legacy==
Kuroki retired from public life in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuroki_privacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Ex-porn star wins settlement in Japan|archiveurl=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/51935.html|archivedate=2007-04-14|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20070414p2a00m0na001000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[April 14]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the January 2002 issue of the magazine ''Josei Seven'', and the January 2004 issue of ''Shukan Post'', stories and pictures on Kuroki's private life were printed. Kuroki claimed that as an ordinary citizen no longer in the public eye, the magazines needed her permission to print these stories. Kuroki sued the publisher, [[Shogakukan]], for 22 million yen for invasion of privacy. In April, 2007, the presiding judge ruled the articles illegal and awarded Kuroki 1.7 million yen (about $14,000). Shogakukan was reportedly considering appealing the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuroki_privacy&quot;/&gt;

At the height of her popularity, Kuroki's AVs were averaging 17,000 sales a piece, a huge amount by industry standards, exceeding a million dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bornoff-617&quot;/&gt; According to Rosemary Iwamura, &quot;Kaoru changed the image of AV girls; she didn't seem to be making videos because of a lack of options but rather as an informed choice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iwamura&quot;/&gt; For bringing the AV industry to the attention of mainstream media in Japan, as well as her polite but frank outspokenness on subjects like sex and censorship, Kjell Fornander calls her &quot;the first high-profile AV actress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fornander&quot;/&gt; She permanently changed the way that the AV industry and AV actresses were viewed by the general public in Japan.

{{nihongo|'''Ai Kurosawa'''|黒沢愛|Kurosawa Ai}} is a famous award-winning [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Model (person)|model]] and [[AV idol]]. She made her debut in the adult entertainment field in 2001, and after appearing in dozens of AVs (adult videos), she retired in 2006 but made a comeback in 2007.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Ai Kurosawa was born in [[Shiga Prefecture]] on December 24, 1982. During high school she was very active in volleyball,&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_40.html|title=Kurosawa Ai: Best Video Interview|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=www.jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her hobbies as an adult include collecting [[Sanrio|Sanrio's]] [[Hello Kitty]] goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVidol_Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=735|title=Kurosawa(Ai Kurosawa)|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa did not become sexually active at a very early age, later stating, &quot;I was really into volleyball when I was in junior high, so I didn't have time for boys.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt;

Her first sexual encounter was during her first year in high school. She says that her first pleasurable experience with sex came later, however. &quot;When I was seventeen,&quot; she says, &quot;I went out with my first guy who was good at sex. He made me think 'this is real sex.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; 

Kurosawa dropped out of high school and worked in a variety of service-sector jobs including waitressing at a coffee shop and a sushi bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; When she was first scouted to appear in an Adult Video she was receptive to the idea. Recalling AVs she had seen in her father's collection, she later explained, &quot;I thought some of the girls were so pretty, and I wanted to have pictures of myself taken like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut===
Ai Kurosawa made her AV debut with the [[Alice Japan]] label in their April 27, 2001 release ''Scenery of Love'' aka ''Love Scene''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVidol_Profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2001.htm|title=2001|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played the role of a college girl who moves to [[Tokyo]] to be near a man whom she loves. When she learns that he already has a girlfriend, she seduces him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scenery of Love&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2022|title=''Scenery of Love''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV078|title=''Love Scene''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her appearance in this first video, Kurosawa was described &quot;an innocent cutie pie, who shines like a jewel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scenery of Love&quot;/&gt; 

Kurosawa says of this first experience in an adult video, &quot;I was really nervous. But it was different than I had imagined... I thought it would be more hard core.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt;

Her second video, ''Let's Make Love'', released the following month, was a non-narrative series of sex scenes. Bathtub, bathrobe and blindfolding were featured in this AV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2025|title=''Let's Make Love''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa's third video, ''Balloon Breasts'' was released in June. Her &quot;beautiful F-cup breasts&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV142|title=''Bubbly Heaven''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; are highlighted in this video. They are shown off in various costumes, massaged, and put to work for a ''[[paizuri]]'' demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2027|title=''Balloon Breasts''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work and her second video were combined on a single [[DVD]] entitled ''Let's Make Love'', and released in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV102|title=''Let's Make Love''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurosawa's fifth video, ''Dynamite Tits'' (released October 2001), was made with Cosmos Plan, and was her first video made with a company other than [[Alice Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IG39|title=''Dynamite Tits''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, after the filming of this AV, and after the release of her second video, Kurosawa was interviewed. When asked to comment on her work in the AV industry up to this point, she replied, &quot;It's pretty fun... Sex in the videos is just different than in private. After all, you usually don't have sex with people watching you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt;

Alice Japan's ''Costume-Play Doll: Sex Doll In School Uniform'' released in August 2001, had Kurosawa playing the role of a spy. By using this story device to put her in various costumes, including a cheerleader and a stuffed animal, the video made use of the popular ''[[cosplay]]'' genre of adult video in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2033|title=''Costume-Play Doll: Sex Doll In School Uniform''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Kurosawa co-starred with AV actress Shinohara Makoto in another ''cosplay'' video for Alice Japan, ''Costume Play Maniana 2''. Among the costumes she wore in this video were Chinese attire and a military uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV112|title=''Costume Play Maniana 2''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; VIP's ''Black Love'', also from January 2002, was a dramatic mystery involving serial murders in a small village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIP111|title=''Black Love''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD082|title=''Black Love''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ai Kurosawa [Animation Costume Play]'' (March 22, 2002), Kurosawa took the ''cosplay'' genre into animation. This VIP production featured Kurosawa having sex while dressed as various ''[[anime]]'' characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV142|title=''Ai Kurosawa [ Animation Costume Play]''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003 Kurosawa co-starred in the Shintōhō ''[[pink film]]'', ''Lesbian Politicians'' with Japan's first hardcore pornographic actress, [[Kyoko Aizome]], who also directed the film. Released theatrically on April 25, 2003, it was presented on video by Alice Japan in September of that year.

===Documentary-inspired AVs===
The similarity between many Japanese adult videos and the documentary film has often been pointed out by critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/round-up_005.shtml|title=''Every Japanese Woman Makes Her Own Curry'' (review)|accessdate=2007-06-04|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com Midnight Eye]|quote=The similarities between the two genres [documentary and hardcore Adult Video] - the recording of real, non-simulated action with the rawness of the production a testament to its vérité nature - have been picked up on by critics numerous times before.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kurosawa's next video made use of that format. Alice Japan's ''Bubbly Heaven'', from March 2002, is in the popular [[soapland]] sub-genre of these documentary-inspired AVs. The video shows Kurosawa experiencing sexual service from an actor and a professional prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9165|title=''Bubbly Heaven''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As Nicholas Bornoff points out, &quot;Sometimes the documentary is faked, predictably with sadistic themes, which nonetheless strive to maintain a spontaneous veneer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=Chapter 18 (Naked Dissent)|page=608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Kurosawa videos in the mock-documentary genre included VIP's ''Ai Kurosawa's Sex Training'' of April 2003, in which she is tortured and forced to obey the video director's every command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD161|title=''Ai Kurosawa's Sex Training''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another video in the mock-documentary format was ''Ai Kurosawa's Hypnotic Fuck'' from Cosmos Plan. This AV has Kurosawa purportedly hypnotized, after which her &quot;deep sexual desires are revealed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=EMD003|title=''Ai Kurosawa's Hypnotic Fuck''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlas21===
In February 2003, after having worked with several companies, mostly [[Alice Japan]], Kurosawa released ''Sexy Pearl'', her first video for Atlas21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=A03023|title=''Sexy Pearl''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''COS-PARA'', of March 2003, was Kurosawa's entry in the company's popular ''cosplay'' series. The costumes worn by Kurosawa in this video include that of a waitress and a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=A03032|title=''COS-PARA''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlas21 combined these two videos onto one DVD entitled ''Ai Kurosawa FREAK'', in May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=AVD139|title=''Ai Kurosawa FREAK''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2003, Kurosawa appeared in two multi-actress videos for Atlas21. The theme of ''Women On Top'' of August 2003 is explained in the title, and the video featured thirteen AV actresses having sex in the titular position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=A03081|title=''Women On Top''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Erotic Breasts Girls'' of November, 2003 starred seven AV actresses known for the beauty of their breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=A03111|title=''Erotic Breasts Girls''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, Kurosawa co-starred in ''TMA The Big and Extreme Breasts Premium II'', a similar multi-actress anthology for the TMA label. This video included AV idols [[Anna Ohura]] and [[Kyoko Ayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=11ID090|title=''TMA The Big and Extreme Breasts Premium II''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition - Retirement - Comeback===
With her &quot;perfectly proportioned body forged from years of volleyball coupled with a G-cup bust,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; Kurosawa had become one of the most popular and prominent AV actresses of the early 2000s. The AV industry recognized her career on November 26, 2003, when she was given the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2003 SOD Awards|SOD Award]] for outstanding actress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nana_Natsume_Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_79.html|last=Woo|first=Ex-S (translator)|date=[[2003-11-27]]|title=[[Nana Natsume]] Interview|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=www.jmate.com|quote=...when you saw Ai Kurozawa take the award for outstanding actress yesterday...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese mainstream media also paid tribute to Kurosawa when she won the &quot;Main AV Actress Award&quot; at the 2nd [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2nd Takeshi Kitano Awards (2001)|Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards]] ceremony for her work in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/model.cfm?actress_filename=ai_kurosawa|title=Ai Kurosawa|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=[www.actionjav.com ActionJAV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ai Kurosawa retired from AVs in January 2006, but continued performing as a [[striptease]] dancer. She came out of retirement in August 2007 to do a series of videos for [[Crystal-Eizou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/D_BANK/2007NOV/beejin-00588.html|title=Resurrection Goddess|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/ JSexNetwork]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her second video for Crystal, ''Welcome to Bakunyu Soapland'', she plays a sex industry worker at a [[soapland]] establishment who gives her customers more than a massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/D_BANK/2008JAN/beejin-00682.html|title=Bubble Princess|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/ JSexNetwork]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also did a photo session for Crystal in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/actress/archives/2007/09/2007_0929_1900.php|title=黒沢愛 サイン＆撮影会 (Ai Kurosawa Autograph &amp; Photo Session|date=September 29, 2007|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=[http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/ www.crystal-eizou.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Kurosawa ventured into a new area for her, &quot;uncensored&quot; videos. These do not have the mosaic blurring of the genitals found in all standard Japanese porn and are meant for international markets and underground ([[Urabon]]) Japanese sales. She appeared in a series of online videos for XVN.JP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monthly.xvn.jp/ja/list/actor/all/publishdate/picturecomment/10/0/4622|title=全作品一覧&gt; 黒沢愛 (Ai Kurosawa Full Works Online|accessdate=2008-10-30|publisher=[http://monthly.xvn.jp/ monthly.xvn.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several DVDs from the same material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.xvn.jp/ja/list/actor/all/publishdate/picturecomment/10/0/4622|title=全作品一覧&gt; 黒沢愛 (Ai Kurosawa Full Works DVD|accessdate=2008-10-30|publisher=[http://monthly.xvn.jp/ monthly.xvn.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Jun Kusanagi''' / '''June Kusanagi'''|草凪純|Kusanagi Jun|extra=born [[June 5]], [[1978]]}} is a [[Japan]]ese model and [[AV idol]] famous for her metric [[Brassiere measurements|G-cup]]-sized bust.&lt;ref name=&quot;China Post&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/detail.asp?ID=39085&amp;GRP=B|title=Japanese adult-video star's shows banned over permit|accessdate=2008-02-02|date=[[July 5]], [[2003]]|publisher=[[The China Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her appearances in AVs, adult cinema, photobooks, magazines and television, she has been called &quot;a super popular AV actress&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV088|title=''Mizuho Kano Special''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &quot;one of Japan's most prolific and popular photo model/AV stars,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=J.|first=Lee|url=http://www.asian-sirens.com/junkusanagi/bio.html|title=Biography|accessdate=2007-05-19|date=[[May 9]], [[2006]]|publisher=www.asian-sirens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;one of the biggest AV legends ever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mizuho Kano DX&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2220|title=''Body Play: Intoxication of Eros''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|quote=Mizuho Kano is one of the biggest AV legends ever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
===Early life===
Jun Kusanagi was born in [[Tokyo]] on [[June 5]], [[1978]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?knumzh00|title={{nihongo2|加納瑞穂}} - Kanou Mizuho|accessdate=2007-05-14|publisher=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic' (Idol Dictionary)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese term ''kubire'', referring to &quot;the inward dip of a woman's waist&quot; is often applied to Kusanagi's remarkably small waist and large breasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlist.com/SEARCH/kusanagi/1/|title=GRDV029   FETISH MODE -- Jun Kusanagi|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=www.jlist.com|quote=well recognized for her all natural curves known as kubire... The legendary Queen of Kubire, Jun Kusanagi...}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to what she attributed her figure, Kusanagi commented, &quot;I go to fitness club, facial cares, and I do exercise at my home too... I did sit-ups a lot of times. When I was high school, I could do 200.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/alice/MIZUHO/TINT.HTM|title=Forever Mizuho|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=xxx.xcity.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV debut===
Kusanagi made the first of her &quot;uniformly excellent hard core videos&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; in October, 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pin Pin Girl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1068|title=''Pin Pin Girl''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because publishing companies own model's stage names, it is not uncommon for an AV actress to use more than one name during her career as she moves from company to company. Jun Kusanagi debuted with the MAX-A studio under the name {{nihongo|'''Mizuho Kano'''|加納瑞穂|Kanō Mizuho}}, and continued to use that name in appearances for MAX-A and [[Alice Japan]] even after she had begun using the name Jun Kusanagi for other companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; She has also used the stage names {{nihongo|'''Narua Asami'''|淺海成亞|Asami Narua}}, and {{nihongo|'''Kirin Junna'''|純名きりん|Junna Kirin}}. Her AV debut was in the video ''Pin Pin Girl''. Called a &quot;sensational debut release,&quot; the film was directed by Yuji Sakamoto.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pin Pin Girl&quot;/&gt; Kusanagi appeared in five more adult videos during the next six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; She made one more video for MAX-A in November,&lt;ref name=&quot;Body Play: Intoxication of Eros&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1071|title=''Body Play: Intoxication of Eros''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then moved to the [[Alice Japan]] label in December where she made the other four.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obscene Model&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1820|title=''Obscene Model''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kusanagi's first two videos included sex scenes, but focused on featuring her slim figure and large breasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pin Pin Girl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Body Play: Intoxication of Eros&quot;/&gt; ''Obscene Model'', her first work for Alice Japan, also directed by Sakamoto, went into more adventurous realms, including S&amp;M and &quot;aggressive vibrator&quot; scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obscene Model&quot;/&gt; In ''Body Report'' of January 1997, Kusanagi's figure is again the focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1823|title=''Body Report''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Sexy Butt'', of April 1997, focuses specifically on one part of her anatomy, and various sexual acts performed upon it. Typical of many Japanese AVs, some bondage is included in this video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1833|title=''Sexy Butt''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kusanagi's fourth video for Alice Japan, ''Reverse Soap Heaven'', was in the popular genre of a prominent AV actress performing in a [[soapland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9047|title=''Reverse Soap Heaven''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having made six AVs, Kusanagi stopped performing in videos for a time to concentrate on modeling.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; Her &quot;beauty and volcanic on-screen sexuality&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mizuho Kano DX&quot;/&gt; had quickly made her a top AV performer, and as a farewell tribute to the model, Alice Japan issued a compilation video entitled ''Mizuho Kanou Forever'' in July of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1840|title=''FOREVER''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; Kusanagi apparently had dental work done soon after her break from AV performance, as her subsequent appearances in [[photobook]]s and magazines show that her teeth, previously slightly crooked, were now straight.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; Appearing under the stage name Narua Asami, the first of Kusanagi's five [[photobook]]s, ''Queen Bee'', was released in August of 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-books&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asian-sirens.com/junkusanagi/books.html|title=Books|accessdate=2007-03-03|date=[[February 26]], [[2006]]|publisher=www.asian-sirens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several magazine appearances under this stage name followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt;

===First AV come-back===
Kusanagi's come-back video, again with [[Alice Japan]] under the name Mizuho Kano, was in March 1998 with ''Big Tits Rebirth''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Big Tits Rebirth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1871|title=''Big Tits Rebirth''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; After this come-back she released about one video a month for the next year and a half.&lt;ref name=&quot;avidol-Mizuho&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=109|title=Mizuho (Kanou Mizuho)|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her return to the AV industry, an observer commented, &quot;Her body is more mature and mysterious now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/variety/mon/intervie/W17/|title=Mizuho Kanou: 15 naughty questions; A Maniac course|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=xxx.xcity.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Eichi Publishing, Kusanagi appeared in her second photobook, ''Kubire'', which was released in April of 1998. This was her first appearance under the name Jun Kusanagi. She continued appearing in videos for Alice Japan as Mizuho Kano, while making video and magazine appearances as Jun Kusanagi when working for Eichi during this same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; The photobook ''Kubire 2'' came out in December of 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-books&quot;/&gt;

Kusanagi's videos at this time delved into several of the most popular genres in Japanese adult videos, including S&amp;M,&lt;ref name=&quot;Big Tits Rebirth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1880|title=''Tits -NYUTON-tNYUTON''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[cosplay]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1874|title=''Big Tits Dynamite''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=8A083|title=''NEO Bloody Uniform Connection 43''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a documentary-style video which was filmed in her own apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=8A074|title=''Legend Of An AV Idol''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other documentary-style videos focused on the video audience. In ''Home Delivery Soapland'', Kusanagi makes house-calls for &quot;the poor lonely guy who watches our videos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=S98096|title=''Home Delivery Soapland''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kusanagi's fans were invited to enter an Internet contest, and the winners appeared with the actress in the January 1999 release, ''Saint Lady Molester''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9090|title=''Saint Lady Molester''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her February, 1999 video for Alice Japan, ''Super Horny Monsters Legend 3'', she was teamed with fellow big-bust AV model Mai Shiina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV011|title=''Super Horny Monsters Legend 3''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second retirement and come-back===
In August 1999, Kusanagi again released a farewell appearance, the photobook ''Jun'', and a calendar for the year 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-biography&quot;/&gt; Two years later, with ''[[Playboy]]'' photographer, Kim Mizuno, Kusanagi produced an 80-page, hardcover volume entitled ''Dangerous Curve''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzwomen.com/junebook.html|title=Dangerous Curve Photo Book featuring June Kusanagi|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=www.mzwomen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in April 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;asian-sirens-books&quot;/&gt; the photography in the book was called, &quot;right up there with Kim's best work.&quot; However Kusanagi appeared to have lost a lot of weight since her retirement, leading to speculation that she may have been suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asian-sirens.com/junkusanagi/news.html|title=Great News and Sad News|accessdate=2007-03-03|date=[[May 9]], [[2006]]|publisher=www.asian-sirens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her diary she expressed disappointment that she felt her career had failed. It could be due to a combination of bad business decisions, and the fact that she passed her prime so quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.june2525.com/2525d-frame.html|title=香港より・・・|accessdate=2008-02-06|date=[[June 18]],[[2005]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another retirement from public life during the first half of the 2000s followed, during which time the Alice Japan, Atlas21 and MAX-A labels released several compilations of scenes from Kusanagi's previous work, as well as re-issues of the original videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;avidol-Mizuho&quot;/&gt;

In July 2003, Kusanagi followed AV idols [[Ai Iijima]] and [[Madoka Ozawa]] by seeking to expand her career in [[Taiwan]]. She performed at a multimedia show in [[Taipei]]'s World Trade Center. Though her appearance in the country created a media frenzy, she became a subject of countroversy when it was claimed that she was working in the country without a permit. She had to cancel performances on the second day of her planned 3-day tour of the country. Kusanagi's agent in Taiwan claimed that she was not actually working in the country, but that she was only engaging in photo opportunities, shopping and visiting fans. Local Chinese-language newspapers, however, reported that she had been paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Yun-Ping|last=Chang|title=Porn star subject of growing probe|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/07/05/2003058110|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=[[July 5]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;China Post&quot;/&gt;

In May 2006, ten years after her debut, she released a new DVD with [[Crystal-Eizou]] called {{nihongo|''Comeback!! Queen of Kubire Jun Kusanagi''|復活！！くびれの女王 草凪純}}. The June issue of ''Urecco'' magazine devoted a feature to Kusanagi's return to the AV world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlist.com/SEARCH/kusanagi/1/|title=MGZ643 Urecco June 2006 vol. 259|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=www.jlist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kusanagi made several more videos after this second comeback, many in the &quot;mature woman&quot; or &quot;madame&quot; genre for [[Madonna (studio)|Madonna]], but also including [[Creampie (sexual act)|nakadashi]] and simulated rape releases for [[Attackers]] and an interracial video (''Black Men And Promiscuity'') for [[Moodyz]].

Kusanagi has been featured in U.S. publications ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', an unusual achievement for a Japan-based model.&lt;ref name=&quot;shinnihoneizo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shinnihoneizo.co.jp/xces/2009/kaisetu/15-a.html|title= 高校教師 爆乳をもてあそばれて|accessdate=2009-09-14|publisher=[http://www.shinnihoneizo.co.jp/xces/ www.shinnihoneizo.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has appeared on various Japanese TV shows including ''[[Gilgamesh Night]]'' and the [[TV Asahi]] variety show [[:ja:トゥナイト2|''Tonight 2'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;shinnihoneizo&quot;/&gt; At the height of her career she was called the most popular AV actress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DC043|title=''Female Ass''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|quote=The most popular AV actress...}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{nihongo|'''Marina Matsushima'''|松嶋まりな|Matsushima Marina|extra=born [[December 24]], [[1980]]}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] adult film actress and [[AV idol]] famous for her large J cup (DD cup in American measurements) natural [[breasts]].

==Life and career==
Matsushima was scouted from her OL ([[office lady]]) job by a talent scout for adult films. She has supposedly forsaken [[brassiere|bra]]s because they are essentially unavailable in her size in Japan. She has released many movies that focus on her large breasts.

Her first AV was the March 2001 release, {{nihongo|''Enormous Breasts DNA''|爆乳 DNA|Bakyunyu DNA}}, for the [[Crystal-Eizou]] company's Grace label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2001.htm|title=2001|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was featured in the May, 2004 omnibus collection from TMA, ''The Charismatic Idol BEST COLLECTION'' with fellow big-bust [[AV idol]], [[Kyoko Ayana]]. The video focused on a variety of styles of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=TWV082|title=''The Charismatic Idol BEST COLLECTION''|accessdate=2007-04-28|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matsushima has done several [[breast fetishism|fetish]] photobooks and videos in the [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] genre. Her later performances depict her as the aggressor, dominating her male co-stars. Japanese [http://www.amazon.co.jp/s?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%8F%BC%93%88%82%DC%82%E8%82%C8 Amazon] shows 25 DVDs, 13 VHS tapes and 6 photo-books featuring Marina Matsuhima currently available. 

The [[Tokyo Topless]] website, which has been in existence since March 1995, and claims to be the first adult site in Asia has devoted two photo features to Marina Matsushima with photographer Seiji Okamura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tokyotopless.com/model/MarinaMATSUSHIMA/01/|title=Marina MATSUSHIMA 01|accessdate=2007-06-09|work=tokyotopless.com|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tokyotopless.com/model/MarinaMATSUSHIMA/02/|title=Marina MATSUSHIMA 02|accessdate=2007-06-09|work=tokyotopless.com|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The July, 2004 release of her DVD ''Fetish Diva'' gave her a third feature at the site, this time photographed by Koji Yokoyama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tokyotopless.com/model/MarinaMATSUSHIMA/03/|title=Marina MATSUSHIMA 03|accessdate=2007-06-09|work=tokyotopless.com|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Kimiko Matsuzaka'''|松坂 季実子|Matsuzaka Kimiko}} is a Japanese [[AV idol]] who was prominent during the late-1980s and early-1990s noted for her large [[breasts]]. Authorities on the AV point to Matsuzaka's career as the beginning of the &quot;Big Bust Boom&quot; in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adachi-Kyonyu-Boom&quot;&gt; Adachi, Noriyuki. (1992). {{nihongo|''&quot;Adult&quot; People''|アダルトな人びと|Adaruto na Hitobito}} Kodansha. ISBN 4-06-205546-5. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
=== AV Debut ===
Born in [[Kobe]] either February 10, or October 21, 1969, Kimiko Matsuzaka was attending [[Otsuma Women's University]] when she was scouted by AV director {{nihongo|[[Toru Muranishi]]|[[:ja:村西とおる|村西とおる]]}}. She made her debut with {{nihongo|Diamond Image|[[:ja:ダイヤモンド映像|ダイヤモンド映像]]}} in 1989.
Her stage name was taken from a combination of &quot;Matsuzaka&quot;, from actress {{nihongo|[[Keiko Matsuzaka]]|[[:ja:松坂慶子|松坂慶子]]}}, and &quot;Kimiko&quot; from the actress {{nihongo|[[Kimiko Ikegami]]|[[:ja:池上季実子|池上季実子]]}}. Her bust size was advertised as 110.7 centimeters (43 1/2 inches), but this was a publicity gimmick employing a pun on &quot;ii onna&quot; or &quot;good woman&quot; (110 pronounced &quot;ii o&quot;, and &quot;7&quot; resembling the [[Katakana]] &quot;{{nihongo2|ナ}}&quot; – &quot;na&quot;). According to {{nihongo|[[:ja:本橋信宏|Motohashi Nobuhiro]]|本橋信宏}}, her bust size was actually in the upper 90s.

Though large breasts had been admired in Japanese erotic cinema since at least the 1950s, with the popularity of actress [[Michiko Maeda|Maeda Michiko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anderson, Joseph L. and Donald Richie|year=1982|title=The Japanese Film: Art and Industry (Expanded Edition)|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-00792-6}}, p.266-267&lt;/ref&gt; the success of Matsuzaka, and other large-breasted performers of this time, such as {{nihongo|Reiko Kato|[[:ja:かとうれいこ|かとうれいこ]]}} led the establishment of the Big Bust genre as part of the Japanese AV industry.

=== Success ===
Originally scheduled for only one video, her debut video, {{nihongo|''Dekkaino, Mekke!''|でっか～いの、めっけ!}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1989.htm|title=1989|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a huge hit for the Diamond Eizo company, selling several thousand copies shortly after its release on [[February 1]], [[1989]]. Capitalizing on this success, Diamond Image named the first day of the month {{nihongo|&quot;Large Breast Day&quot;|&quot;巨乳の日&quot;|Kyonyu no Hi}}, and released a Kimiko Matsuzaka video on the first day of each month for nearly two years. Noriyuki Adachi singles out Matsuzaka's second AV, ''1107 Millimeter Impression'', as the one that set the {{nihongo|&quot;Big Bust Boom&quot;|巨乳ブーム|&quot;Kyonyu Boom&quot;}} &quot;on fire.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adachi-Kyonyu-Boom&quot;/&gt; The storyline of her fifth video, &quot;Daughter!&quot; (released June 1, 1989), had her playing the role of a news reporter. From this point on, she would be cast in a different profession with each appearance. In her following videos she would play a doctor, an attorney, a journalist, a professional golfer, and even a high government official, among other occupations.&lt;ref&gt; {{nihongo|''Popular Weekly''|週刊大衆}} 12/11/1989 &quot;Heisei no Madonna&quot; – contains a review of all her videos up to #10, ''Director Kimiko''&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-1989 and mid-1990, she appeared with [[Kaoru Kuroki]] in director Toru Muranishi's series of instructional sex videos demonstrating sexual techniques and the use of sexual toys while Kuroki provided the lecture/commentary. By now known internationally as a &quot;queen of pornos&quot;, in an interview with [[Associated Press]] in mid-1990, it was reported that Matsuzaka made over five times the average salary for a woman her age. Matsuzaka said that she was happy with her career and commented, &quot;I see myself as a success story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japanese Values Changing|curly=y |agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[The Intelligencer (Doylestown, Pennsylvania)|The Intelligencer]]|publisher=[[Calkins Media]]|location=[[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]|page=27|date=1990-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond her high-profile AV career, Matsuzaka had by now become a mainstream celebrity. She was one of the voice actresses for two volumes of an adult science-fiction anime video ({{nihongo2|妖獣教室}}), released May 25 and July 27, 1990 by [[Daiei]] through its &quot;dez&quot; label, and was very active appearing in photo books and weekly magazines, having regular appearances in {{nihongo|''Popular Weekly''|週刊大衆}} and {{nihongo|''Tokyo Sports Newspaper''|[http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/ 東京スポーツ新聞]}}. With actor/comedian [[LaSalle Ishii]], she recorded the musical vocal duet {{nihongo|''Soresore dousuruno?''|ソレソレどうするの?}}, which was released on November 25, 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adachi-50&quot;/&gt; ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Pacific Stars and Stripes]]'' reported that Matsuzaka had made several appearances in prime-time television dramas, and was a talkshow regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One Japanese Industry That's Not Thriving; Changing Values Are Impediments to Sex Business|curly=y |agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Pacific Stars and Stripes]]|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|page=9|date=1990-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a regular on television variety shows such as {{nihongo|''All Night Fuji''|オールナイトフジ}}.&lt;ref&gt; ''Dolive'' February, 1990, p.59 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retirement ===
Matsuzaka made her last AV, ''Sexual Game'', in October 1990. AV director Toru Muranishi called her departure from the industry one of the worst news items affecting the AV industry in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adachi-50&quot;&gt;Adachi, p.50 &lt;/ref&gt; A year and eight months after her debut, she had starred in 21 AVs, helping to build Muranishi's company, Diamond Image, into the largest AV company in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adachi-50&quot;/&gt; Within a year after Matsuzaka's departure, Diamond Image would declare bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt; Fornander, Kjell. (1992). [http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html &quot;A Star is Porn&quot;] in ''[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]'', July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; After retirement from AV appearances, she appeared with Kaoru Kuroki at the [[Akasaka]] club, &quot;Mirukuhooru&quot; (&quot;Milk Hall&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Adachi, p.51 &lt;/ref&gt; She ceased all public appearances in the spring of 1991, citing personal problems. It was later reported that she had taken up work as a commuting office lady.&lt;ref&gt; {{nihongo|''Friday''|フライデー}} September 24, 1993 and &quot;Where are They Now&quot; -{{nihongo2|「あの人は今」}}, {{nihongo|''Weekly Post''|週刊ポスト}} July 26th, 1996 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Aika Miura'''|三浦あいか|Miura Aika}} is a popular and award-winning Japanese [[AV idol]] who made a clear mark on the AV industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KDH084|title=''AIKA LOVEs YOU 2''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a remarkably long and prolific career for an AV actress, she released an average of one film a month over a seven year period-- excepting 1998-- before she retired in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_26.html|title=Special Interview of Miura Aika|year=2001|accessdate=2007-06-11|work=[http://www.jmate.com/ Jmate]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Aika's birth name is {{nihongo|Yuu Hasegawa|長谷川優|Hasegawa Yuu}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIKA x AIKA&quot;/&gt; She was born to a conservative family in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]] on November 2, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?muraik00|title=三浦あいか - Miura Aika|accessdate=2007-06-11|work=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic' (Idol Dictionary)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though her family did not approve of her working in the AV industry, they remained close to her throughout her career. When her father once scolded her for making money from pleasure, Miura pointed out that some of her performances involved [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]], and observed, &quot;It's not as fun as you think!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate-interview&quot;/&gt;

===Debut and early career===
Miura made her AV debut on [[Kuki Inc.|KUKI]]'s Tank label in the March 1995 release ''I Love You'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1995.htm|title=1995|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Summer Memory'' (September 1995) was in the popular but controversial exhibitionistic genre of Japanese adult video which would later earn AV actress [[Asuka Yuki]] an arrest a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Naked walk earns bust for actress|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Top_News/2006/08/25/naked_walk_earns_bust_for_actress/8133/|work=[[United Press International]]|date=August 25, 2006|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Miura's video all the sex scenes were filmed outside, including at a beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT116|title=''Summer Memory''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Costume Doll'' (October 1995), Miura entered the ''[[cosplay]]'' genre. Among the costumes she wore in this video were those of a nurse, a bride, a high school girl, and a pizza delivery girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT122|title=''Costume Doll''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Setting off on a Trip'' (November 1995) had Miura in the role of a young woman who travels to [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]] to meet a famous artist, only to discover that the man is a lecherous old pervert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT126|title=''Setting off on a Trip''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her December 1995 video, ''Fantasy'', won an award from ''Video Boy'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT133|title=''Fantasy''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;probably the most popular AV mag in Japan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ms2/jav/magz.htm|title=Japanese AV Magazines|accessdate=2009-08-24|publisher=[http://www.angelfire.com/ www.angelfire.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wet &amp; Deep Love'', released January 1996, had Miura working in the popular rape and S&amp;M genres of Japanese pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT137|title=''Wet &amp; Deep Love''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short retirement and return===
With ''Countdown'', from February 1996, Miura announced the first of her temporary retirements, which would last only until May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT143|title=''Countdown''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this break, Kuki released ''Aika Miura Maniac'' (April 1996), a collection of never-before-seen scenes from previous videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT154|title=''Aika Miura Mania''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1996, Miura returned and adopted the single-name &quot;AIKA&quot;, all in Roman-alphabet capitals, as her stage name.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIKA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1996.htm|title=1996|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Poison'' (June 1996) had Miura shedding the somewhat innocent personona she had cultivated until then by introducing scenes of anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT166|title=''POISON''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kjell Fornander describes the trajectory that Miura's career had assumed at this point. He says, &quot;Viewers are invited to follow, from appearance to appearance, her sexual initiation, dawning self-awareness and gradual acceptance of her inner, dark depths.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-08-10|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|publisher=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2006-05-16|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''1000 Carat'', released in July 1996, continued this exploration of more adventurous and extreme themes. In this video, Miura takes the dominant role in the sex scenes in this erotic drama in which she plays a challenging and serious role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT174|title=''1000 carat''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''AIKA Freak'', released the following month, included scenes of outdoor group sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT179|title=''ＡＩＫＡ ＦＥＲＡＫ[sic]''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1996, Miura appeared in the 26th entry in the Atlas label's popular and long-running ''NEO Bloody Uniform'' series of ''cosplay''-themed videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=6A105|title=''NEO Bloody Uniform Connection 26''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Atlas, Miura made a three-year career retrospective video entitled ''Legend Of An AV Idol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=7A092|title=''Legend Of An AV Idol''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice Japan]]'s ''Inhumanity'' (December 1997), had Miura in the role of a newlywed bride who suffers from amnesia after being hit by a car. Nine different men claim to be her husband, and she must perform fellatio on each one to find out who the real groom is. They all turn out to be imposters when the real husband shows up and the video concludes with Miura engaging in sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9063|title=''Inhumanity''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''The Last Video -Aika Miura-'', the actress again took a break from appearing in AVs. Though she would continue pursuing her career as a stripper, this vacation from the AV industry would last from January until November 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=8A011|title=''The Last Video -Aika Miura-''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final come-back and retirement===
Though she had repeatedly retired and come back, after five years Miura still had a strong following. In 2000 Kuki released several DVD collections of her previous videos for her fan-base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KDV096|title=''AIKA LOVEs YOU 3''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, six years after her debut, she starred in the theatrically-released, widescreen film ''Aika Miura - Streetcar Ecstasy'' (三浦あいか　痴漢電車エクスタシー).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2001/dy002280.htm|title=三浦あいか　痴漢電車エクスタシー|accessdate=2007-06-11|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miura retired from AVs the following year. Even in retirement, Miura remained popular enough to warrant further DVD compilation releases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KDV096|title=''FANTASTIC''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and five years after her final retirement a semi-documentary video featuring scenes from throughout her career, was released in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DAJ082|title=''Best of Best, Aika Miura, Deluxe''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Haruki Mizuno'''|水野はるき|Mizuno Haruki}} is a popular [[Japan]]ese [[AV idol|AV]], [[gravure idol]], and mainstream media celebrity.

==Life and career==
Mizuno was born in [[Tokyo]] on [[July 21]] 1979. She dropped out of high school, and thinks that if she had not become an AV star, she would be working at [[soapland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_28.html|title=Body Park Vol. 111: Haruki Mizuno (Interview)|accessdate=2007-02-22|publisher=www.jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking her screen name from the actress [[Maki Mizuno]], whom she considers a role model,&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; Mizuno made her AV debut in December 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1997.htm|title=1997|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first video, ''Barefoot Fairy'', was for the Sexia company's Try Heart label.&lt;ref name=&quot;vinfo.xcity.jp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA032|title=''Barefoot Fairy''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She quickly a sensation in the AV field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA036|title=''Take Off The Ribbon''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a popular [[gravure idol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vinfo.xcity.jp&quot;/&gt;

For nearly one year, Mizuno made about one video a month for Sexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=604|title=Haruki (Mizuno Haruki) (Profile)|accessdate=2007-02-22|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AVIdol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Playing off her &quot;Lolita&quot; image, her third video, the March 1998 release ''Sweet Baby'', had Mizuno portraying the viewer's younger sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA041|title=''Sweet Baby''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her May, 1998 release, ''Pretty Wife 4: Currently In Training'', had Mizuno in the role of a young newlywed who must endure training and discipline not only from her husband, but also from his creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA050|title=''Pretty Wife 4''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sorry'', from August of 1998, Mizuno appeared in the popular student-teacher theme of Japanese AVs, as a student having an affair with her middle-aged teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA059|title=''Sorry''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 1998, Mizuno felt exhausted physically and mentally, and decided to take a hiatus from the AV industry, which would last two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; During her break from AV performances, Mizuno worked in the Japanese mainstream media, and was a regular on the late night [[TV Asahi]] show, {{nihongo|''Blonde Teacher''|金髪先生}} between 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=OSV036|title=''Melody''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her return to AV and Sexia's Try Heart label was with the September 2000 release, ''Reunion''. The AV industry called Mizuno's come-back, &quot;[t]he most shocking event of the last half of this year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA183|title=''Reunion''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More comfortable with the AV field after her return, Mizuno began experimenting with genres in which she had previously refused to perform. Her second come-back video, ''Make Love'' (October, 2000), was her first to include [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and rape scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA187|title=''Make Love''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly ten years after her debut, and eight years after her apparent retirement from the AV field in 2002, her popularity was such that in February, 2007, [http://www.amazon.co.jp/s?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%90%85%96%EC%82%CD%82%E9%82%AB Amazon] still listed over 50 video items to her credit. Sixteen volumes of photo books either devoted entirely to her, such as ''[http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4754212002 FAIRY TALE―{{nihongo2|水野はるき写真集}}]'' (released in October, 1998), or in which she appeared with other models were also in print.

{{nihongo|'''Mariko Morikawa'''|森川まりこ|Morikawa Mariko}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[AV idol]] known for her very large, natural [[breasts]]. Though publicity touted her Japanese brassiere size as a 124-centimeter &quot;Q-cup,&quot; her premier video stated that she was a 104-centimeter I-cup. 
==Life and career==
Mariko Morikawa first appeared in magazine layouts and videos in the early 1990s. She became one of [[Tokyo Topless]]' leading models, appearing in eight layouts there, beginning with [http://tokyotopless.com/model/MarikoMORIKAWA/01/ #1] and concluding with [http://tokyotopless.com/model/MarikoMORIKAWA/07/ #7]. She also served as the hostess of their Internet radio program. 

Her debut AV was the July 1994 Athena release, {{nihongo|''Tits Way Too Huge''|巨大すぎるデカパイ|Kyodai Sugiru Dekapai}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1994.htm|title=1994|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morikawa starred in a theatrical film which was released [[January 5]], [[1995]]. Released through [[Nikkatsu]]'s post-''Roman Porno'' Excess label,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|title=Vital flesh: the mysterious world of Pink Eiga|accessdate=2007-02-19|last=Domenig|first=Roland|date= |year=2002|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041118094603/http://194.21.179.166/cecudine/fe_2002/eng/PinkEiga2002.htm|archivedate=2004-11-18|quote=Excess is an offshoot of Nikkatsu, established in 1988 when Nikkatsu ended Roman Porno production.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Big Tit Monastery''' was a big-bust variation on the [[nunsploitation]] genre. Morikawa's fame reached the [[United States]] where she was featured on the front and back covers of the Summer 1999 issue of ''Oriental Cinema''. Reviewing her ''Cho Nyu Densetsu Q Kono Chichi O Kurae - Morikawa Mariko'', author and critic Damon Foster calls the video &quot;just typical pornographic nonsense, with nudity galore...&quot; About the lead actress, Foster says, &quot;Mariko Morikawa may be considered too 'pudgy' for most men's taste, but I think she's an intense beauty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Damon. (2000). ''Cho Nyu Densetsu Q Kono Chichi O Kurae - Morikawa Mariko'' review in ''Oriental Cinema'' #18 (Summer, 1999), p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morikawa posed and appeared in videos while pregnant before apparently dropping out of sight about 2004. On May 23,2007 Mariko made her reappearance on Tokyo Topless with two additional photo sets ([http://tokyotopless.com/model/MarikoMORIKAWA/08/ #8] and [http://tokyotopless.com/model/MarikoMORIKAWA/09/ #9]).

'''Ayano Murasaki''' (紫彩乃 - Murasaki Ayano) is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[adult video]] (AV) or [[pornographic actress]]. She has been described as one of the top ''jukujo'' (熟女) or &quot;mature&quot; actresses in the AV field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=PTV360|title=Hotaru Akane and Ayano Murasaki SPLASH HEAVEN - 115 minutes|accessdate=2007-06-06|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English|quote=...mature top actress 'Ayano Murasaki'...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Ayano Murasaki was born in the [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] of [[Japan]] on March 29, 1969. She made her adult video debut in late 2003 at the age of 34. The market for &quot;mature woman&quot; or &quot;madame&quot; actresses appeared in Japanese AV in the mid-1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/S_SHINOZAKI/index.html|title=Satomi Shinozaki biography|accessdate=2007-02-18 |format= |work=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/ Shin-Toho History]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by mid-2009 had grown to the point where the major Japanese video supplier DMM listed over 10,000 items with the mature (熟女) keyword.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/digital/videoa/-/list/=/article=keyword/id=1014/|title=動画 ビデオ &gt; ジャンル &gt; 熟女 (Video genre: Mature)|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ DMM]|accessdate=2009-05-25|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murasaki appeared in such &quot;mature woman&quot; videos for the KMP Million Madams label&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.km-produce.com/works/list3.php?dmy=%94%FC%93%FB&amp;tskey=%8E%87%8D%CA%94T&amp;x=33&amp;y=13|title=Ayano Murasaki Filmography|publisher=[http://www.km-produce.com/ www.km-produce.com]|accessdate=2009-05-25|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Madonna (studio)|Madonna]], an AV studio specializing in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madonna-av.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=32/|title=紫彩乃 （むらさきあやの) - Ayano Murasaki Profile &amp; Filmography|publisher=[http://www.madonna-av.com/ www.madonna-av.com]|accessdate=2009-05-25|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in her career, Murasaki performed in videos for the [[CineMagic Co.|Cinemagic]] and [[Dogma studio]]s, known for their hardcore [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] material. Murasaki also starred in a number of &quot;uncensored&quot; videos released outside of Japan by Sky High Entertainment and Oriental Dream Pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;avfantasy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avfantasy.com/search_Products.aspx?section=0&amp;searchBy=starring&amp;keyword=Ayano+Murasaki&amp;StudioID=0&amp;Dept_ID=0&amp;videotype=1|title=Starring Ayano Murasaki|publisher=[http://www.avfantasy.com/ AVFantasy]|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos lack the mosaic censorship of the genitals which is mandatory for all Japanese porn videos.

In 2006 Murasaki was recognized by the AV industry and fans by being nominated for Best Mature Actress at the [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] for her performances in the 2005 broadcast year on Japanese adult TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaori4med.seesaa.net/article/16060476.html|title=日本アダルト放送大賞 2005 (Adult Japan Broadcasting Award 2005) |publisher=[http://kaori4med.seesaa.net/ kaori4med.seesaa.net]|date=April 3, 2006|accessdate=2008-11-07|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Murasaki received an adult film best [[actress]] award for Million Madam.

==Life and career==
===AV debut &amp; VIP===
Nakajima was born on [[March 12]], [[1983]] in [[Saitama Prefecture]], [[Japan]]), and her interests include music and tennis.She made her AV debut in May 2003 with the [[Houyuu Media Produce|h.m.p.]] Platinum Tiffany label.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2003.htm|title=2003|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She debuted with the VIP label in September 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;Private&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIP198|title=''Private''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked exclusively for that VIP label until mid-2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=RBN001|title=''Abnormality''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English|quote=...VIP exclusive 'Kyoko Nakashima'...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIP225|title=''Kyoko Nakajima in One day Soap Lady!''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English|quote=VIP exclusive actress 'Kyoko Nakajima'...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first video for VIP, ''Private'', was in the documentary style popular with Japanese AVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bornoff|first=Nicholas|title=Pink Samurai: An Erotic Exploration of Japanese Society; The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan|origyear=1991|edition=Paperback|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-586-20576-4|chapter=Chapter 18 (Naked Dissent)|quote=...many [adult videos] exploit their very limitations with a conscious effort at documentary realism: the cinema-verite of pornography. Protagonists, cameramen and directors talk throughout the proceedings even as they are taped. In between the sex episodes, the actors discuss what they feel about what they've just done or are about to do.|page=607}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this video, Nakajima takes the documentary format to another level, giving the audience a first-person point-of-view by holding the camera and filming her sex scenes herself. Her partners in the video are actors whom she has invited to her home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Private&quot;/&gt; This debut video was released the following month as a DVD with 60 minutes of bonus material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Close-Up&quot;/&gt;

Her second and third AVs, like her first for VIP, were released first on VHS, and then the following month on DVD with an hour of extra footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD211|title=''Changing Clothes''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD222|title=''Strawberry White Paper/Kyoko Nakashima''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released on October and November 2003, ''Costume Play Mates'', Nakajima's second work, focused on the popular ''[[cosplay]]'' genre of Japanese adult videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIP204|title=''Costume Play Mates''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nakajima followed up her first three releases with a trilogy of videos set in schools. The second and third entries in this series, ''Kyoko Nakajima in Play Girl'' (January 2004) and ''Beautiful Teachers/ Kyoko Nakajima'' (February 2004), were multi-story DVDs. The viewer made the choice of which version of the stories were to be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD232|title=''Kyoko Nakajima in Play Girl''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIPD235|title=''Beautiful Teachers/ Kyoko Nakajima''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004 VIP chose Nakajima to star in the first DVD released under its Ribbon label. The idea of personally engaging her viewers was expanded upon in this video, entitled ''I Will Make You Cum''. The DVD included the gimmick of an [[artificial vagina]] modeled on the Nakajima's genitals. By using the sex toy and the DVD, the viewer was invited to have &quot;virtual sex&quot; with the actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=RBND001|title=''I will make you cum / Kyoko Nakajima''|accessdate=2007-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nakajima made her last video with VIP, ''Sin and Punishment'' in April 2004 with the subsequent DVD release ''Kyoko Nakajima in Human Destruction'' coming out in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=vip236|title=Sin and Punishment|accessdate=2009-07-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=vipd252|title=Kyoko Nakajima in Human Destruction|accessdate=2009-07-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nakajima had seven videos on the list of top-50 sellers at the major adult video retailer av-channel.com for the year of 2004, including the #1 seller: {{nihongo|''Temptation''|ゆうわく|Yuuwaku}}, and the #5 seller: {{nihongo|''What I Can Do For You''|君のためにできること|Kimi no tame ni dekiru koto}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.av-channel.com/ppv/std/item_ranking/ch=actress?ym=2004|title=Pay Per View Products Best 50!!

===Later career &amp; retirement===
After leaving VIP Nakajima began performing for the KMP studio under their Million label where she mostly worked with director Goro Tameike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.km-produce.com/girls/detail.php?gid=2628|title=中島京子|accessdate=2009-07-22|publisher=[http://www.km-produce.com/ www.km-produce.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became part of the company's promotional group of AV actresses, &quot;Million Girls 2004&quot; (ミリオンガールズ２００４).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.km-produce.com/works/detail.php?tid=8583|title=VERY BEST OF 中島京子　完全版|accessdate=2009-07-22|publisher=[http://www.km-produce.com/ www.km-produce.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, Nakajima began a series of videos for a new studio, [[Moodyz]], which continued until early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moodyz.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=6526|title=中島京子(なかじまきょうこ)|accessdate=2009-07-21|publisher=[http://www.moodyz.com/ www.moodyz.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to make AVs with a number of other studios including the November 2007 production ''Sex Counselling for Real Female College Students, Therapist Kyoko Nakajima'', in which she cures her male patients with masturbation and fellatio in her part-time college student job as a sex counselor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=sups013|title=Sex Counselling for Real Female College Students, Therapist Kyoko Nakajima|accessdate=2009-07-22|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nakajima announced her retirement in her Official Blog on December 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/nakajima_kyouko/|title=N Calendar 2007年12月18日|accessdate=2009-07-22|publisher=[http://blog.livedoor.jp/ blog.livedoor.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nana Natsume'''|夏目ナナ|Natsume Nana}} is an award-winning former [[AV idol]] and a well-known celebrity in [[Japan]].

==Life and career==
Natsume was born on [[January 23]], [[1980]] in [[Sakai, Osaka]], [[Japan]] (Her birthdate has usually been reported as 1982 and it is still listed as such on her SOD profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sodc.co.jp/actress/01139.php|title=夏目ナナ (Nana Natsume)|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[http://www.sodc.co.jp/ www.sodc.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her official website has her birth year as 1980).&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialProfile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nananatsume.jp/profile.html|title=Nana Natsume Profile|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[http://www.nananatsume.jp/ Official Website]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from high school Natsume worked in various occupations, including as a [[dental assistant]] and in real estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natsume_JMate_Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_79.html|last=Woo|first=Ex-S (translator)|date=[[2003-11-27]]|title=Nana Natsume Interview|accessdate=2007-04-23|language=English|publisher=www.jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her entertainment career with appearances in ''On Girls' File'' and ''Cure Sick Night'', local late night television shows in [[Osaka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Natsume_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt; She was first scouted for work in the adult entertainment field in 2002. Moving to [[Tokyo]], she appeared in photo features for several magazines including ''[[Shukan Gendai]]'' and ''Weekly Post''. She was also featured in a photobook entitled ''727'' in July 2002 and in an &quot;image&quot; (non-nude) DVD called ''nana'' which was released in November 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natsume_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt;

===AV Debut &amp; Career===
Natsume first appeared for the [[Soft On Demand]] adult video company as the host of their [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#SOD AV Awards (2002-2006)|AV Awards]] ceremony held at [[Tokyo]]'s [[Shinjuku]] Century Hyatt hotel on November 26, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natsume_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt; Her debut video for the company, entitled simply ''Debut'', was released in January, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2003.htm|title=2003|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively sexually conservative and inexperienced, Natsume feels that what stands out in her first video is, &quot;Just how embarrassed I look during the entire thing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Natsume_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt; She claims that her first experiences with both ''[[Mammary intercourse|paizuri]]'' and [[masturbation]] occurred during AV shoots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natsume_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt; One of her videos, ''Final Pussy!'', released in January 2005 is notable for its [[science fiction]] theme. In the movie, directed by [[Noboru Iguchi]], Natsume plays a dangerous character who is the result of a military experiment gone wrong. When sexually aroused, guns burst from her breasts killing whomever she is having sex with. Special makeup effects were by [[Yoshihiro Nishimura]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1883583/|title=Yoshihiro Nishimura|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; well known in Japanese &quot;gore&quot; cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.net/archives/004830.html|title=Saishû seiki! Natsume Nana - kyûkyoku no erosu|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[http://twitchfilm.net/ Twitch Film]|date=January 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkerplus.com/movie/report/report4177.html|title=NIPPON EROTICS plus(R18映画最前線)
|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[http://www.walkerplus.com/ MovieWalker]|date=January 12, 2006|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year in November 2005, she appeared in her first [[bukakke]] movie ''Nana Natsume Showered by Semen'' directed by [[Kazuhiko Matsumoto]], the man who is usually credited with inventing that genre of Japanese pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/=/cid=1sddm716/|title=夏目ナナ 精子浴びる。|accessdate=2009-08-09|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/  DMM]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also of interest is her December 2005 video ''Stripper'', a lesbian love story with former SOD star [[Kurumi Morishita]] directed by ex-SOD director [[TOHJIRO]].

Natsume has received recognition for her work several times, from the media, the AV industry, and from fans.

The newspaper described Natsume as, &quot;one of the biggest stick flick starlets in Japan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryann|last=Connell|title=Ladies flash the cash, but don't want the money shot in their dirty DVDs|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/06/20060605p2g00m0dm014000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060614023417/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/06/20060605p2g00m0dm014000c.html|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[June 5]], [[2006]]|archivedate=2006-06-14|accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natsume remained with SOD for her entire career, usually making about one video a month. Her retirement video, released in October 2007, was an 8 disk, over 16 hour package with scenes chronicling her entire body of work from her debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sodc.co.jp/detailes/sdms_777.php|title=夏目ナナ　引退 (Nana Natsume Retirement)|accessdate=2008-10-19|publisher=[http://www.sodc.co.jp/ www.sodc.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokyo gossip newspapers had previously reported Natsume's announcement that she would retire from the porn industry at the end of October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://d.hatena.ne.jp/turbosk/20070806/1186404652|title=東スポ 夏目ナナ、年齢詐称 (&quot;''Tokyo Sports''&quot; Nana Natsume)|date=[[2007-08-06]]|accessdate=2007-09-01|publisher=[http://d.hatena.ne.jp/turbosk/ hatena.ne.jp/turbosk/]|language=Japanese|quote=2005年の「第14回東京スポーツ映画大賞」で主演AV女優賞に輝いた夏目ナナさん(公式)がAVを引退するそうな。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her retirement from the AV industry, Natsume has continued her work in mainstream media. She was a regular Thursday reporter on the [[NTV (Japan)]] information variety show ''Johnny Word of Mouth'' (くちコミジョニー) from December, 2007 until the show ended in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/kuchikomi/|title=くちコミジョニー (Johnny Word of Mouth)|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[http://www.ntv.co.jp/ NTV]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a featured role playing Rumi Osaki in the [[TV Tokyo]] [[cosplay]] ghost story ''Guren Onna'' (ぐれんオンナ) broadcast in 12 episodes from January 11 to March 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdorama.com/drama.1253.htm|title=Cosplay Yuurei Guren Onna (Guren Onna)

Natsume had a major role in the low-budget action-horror film ''Samurai Zombie'' (Yoroi) which debuted in 2008 at the South Korean Puchon Fantastic Film Festival. The film was directed by [[Tak Sakaguchi]] and produced by SOD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1298724/|title=Yoroi (2008)|accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=[http://imdb.com/ IMDb.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematopics.com/cinema/works/output2.php?oid=9369|title=Yoroi Zombie

Natsume was the voice of a character in the [[Sega]] [[video game]] ''Ryu Ga Gotoku 2'' (龍が如く2) or ''Yakuza 2'' for [[PlayStation 2]] released on December 7, 2006.

In October 2007 she was featured in the popular culture magazine, ''Spa!''. In her article, in which she gave advice to men seeking success in the area of romance, she stressed the virtues of good grooming and personal hygiene to her reading audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Connell|first=Ryann|title=Nose hairs, bad breath ... porn queen fingers filthy turn-offs|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2007/10/20071030p2g00m0dm004000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[October 30]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-12-14|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natsume was able to fulfill a long-time wish by opening a &quot;Healing Salon&quot; (ヒーリングサロン) called TORICO in Osaka which uses aromatic massage oils to heal and relieve fatigue.

In the novel [[Welcome to the NHK]] by Tatsuhiko Takimoto, Rika is referred to as Satou's &quot;favourite&quot; at one point in the series.

{{nihongo|'''Anna Ohura'''|大浦あんな|Ōura Anna}} is a Japanese AV ([[adult video]]) performer and model, known for her prodigious (100-centimeter, metric I-cup) natural breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news ||title=100 Questions with Ohura Anna|url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_39.html|publisher=jmate.com|accessdate=2007-05-02|language=English|quote=In the AV business, Anna is best known for her big breasts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/reviews/article_161.html|title=''Super Angle of Oppai ~ Premium Edition -- Anna Ohura'' (DVD Review)|accessdate=2007-05-02|last=Payne|first=Peter|publisher=www.jmate.com|language=English|quote=...she's famous for her giant breast[s]...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, according to the ''[[Taipei Times]]'', she claimed to have the largest breasts in the Japanese adult film industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura_Taipei_Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news ||title=Measuring up|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/photo/2003/08/08/0000060504|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=8 August 2003|accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Anna Ohura was born in [[Hokkaidō]], the northernmost of the four main islands of Japan, on May 30, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?oouann00|title=大浦 アンナ - Ooura Anna (Profile)|accessdate=2007-05-02|publisher=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic']}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a French father and Japanese mother. Ohura claims that most people think she most closely resembles her father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura 100 Questions&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=100 Questions with Ohura Anna|url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_39.html|publisher=jmate.com|accessdate=2007-05-02|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She says that her grandmother is the person she most respects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura 100 Questions&quot;/&gt;

Ohura is left-handed and has poor eyesight, wearing contact lenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura 100 Questions&quot;/&gt; She enjoys drinking, but smokes only occasionally. She likes [[udon]] noodles, but dislikes [[soba]] noodles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura 100 Questions&quot;/&gt; Ohura's favorite subjects in school were social studies and Japanese, while English and mathematics were her worst.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura 100 Questions&quot;/&gt; As a child, she wished to become a comic book writer, and she has commented that if she had not gone into the adult entertainment field, she would like to have worked as an assistant to a comic book writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura 100 Questions&quot;/&gt;

===AV career===
The AV ([[adult video]]) companies in Japan can be divided into two groups: the &quot;pro&quot; companies, and the &quot;indie&quot; companies. The &quot;pro&quot; companies work with the Japan Software Morality Association, also known as &quot;Sof-Rin&quot;, while the &quot;indie&quot; companies work outside of that organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne_Ohura_Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/reviews/article_161.html|title=''Super Angle of Oppai ~ Premium Edition -- Anna Ohura'' (DVD Review)|accessdate=2007-05-02|last=Payne|first=Peter|publisher=www.jmate.com|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Ohura debuted at age nineteen with the &quot;pro&quot; AV company, [[Crystal-Eizou]] on their Venus label, in the 24 February 2000 release ''Delicious Juicy Fruit'' (たわわな果実 - ''Tawawana Kajitsu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1995.htm|title=1995|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0000AO8WH?redirect=true たわわな果実] product description at amazon.co.jp. Retrieved February 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohura's AV-acting style has been described as that of &quot;a traditional Japanese porn star... In true Japanese fashion, Anna-chan acts demure and somewhat shy, even as she's willingly thrusting her chest out to be touched by a porn star, or opening her legs to receive [[cunnilingus]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne_Ohura_Review&quot;/&gt; 

After several more videos with Crystal-Eizou during her debut year, she also began working for [[Alice Japan]] in December 2000. Her first video for that company, ''Maximum Bust'', featured [[cosplay]], [[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]], and [[bukkake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2007|title=''MAXIMUM BUST''|accessdate=2007-05-02|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/main.htm XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also made several videos with the &quot;pro&quot; company, TMA.

In 2002, Ohura appeared in a photo book focusing on bondage. During the shooting of this volume of photos, the photographer, &quot;bondage master&quot; Haruki Yukimura, suggested that he and Ohura make a video together. The result of this next Ohura/Yukimura collaboration was the September 2003 DVD, ''Secret Feelings'', which Yukimura directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XD-001
|title=''Secret Feelings''|accessdate=2007-05-02|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/main.htm XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohura and Yukimura would team up for another bondage video, ''Big Tits Bondage'' for [[CineMagic Co.|Cinemagic]] which was subsequently re-released by Cinemagic on a 2-video DVD compilation in March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DD130|title=''Big Tits Restrict''|accessdate=2007-05-02|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/main.htm XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the JList website, in these &quot;pro&quot; videos Ohura's &quot;amazing body and erotic style... won her many fans around the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne_Ohura_Review&quot;/&gt; As a sign of her international and mainstream fame, Ohura appeared in [[Taipei]] in 2003, where she was a highlight of an international furniture exposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohura_Taipei_Times&quot;/&gt;

Some critics claim that the &quot;indie&quot; companies, working outside the &quot;Sof-Rin&quot; system, create a more interesting product. Not only do they have greater freedom, but they are also able to attract the better directors and performers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne_Ohura_Review&quot;/&gt; Ohura's debut with the &quot;indie&quot; label, [[Wanz Factory]], was in the October 2003 DVD ''Super Angle of Oppai''. This DVD was praised by comparing it with Ohura's work for &quot;pro&quot; studios, which were judged, &quot;somewhat vanilla and boring, with straight sex and little innovation on the part of the creators.&quot; In contrast, Ohura &quot;really shines in this great new indies release.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne_Ohura_Review&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Madoka Ozawa'''|小沢 まどか|Ozawa Madoka}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[AV idol]] and [[V-Cinema]] actress who has been called &quot;a legend in the business.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;An-I-Novel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=1556|title=''An I Novel''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com/]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became known as the number one AV idol of 1997 after every video she released during her debut year became a hit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=MVC017|title=''SUPER BEST PART 3''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==AV career==

Madoka Ozawa was born [[3 March]], [[1978]] in [[Tokyo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?ozwmdk00|title={{nihongo2|小沢 まどか}} - Ozawa Madoka|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic' (Idol Dictionary)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made her AV debut with the Cosmos Plan label in December 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1996.htm|title=1996|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her debut video, ''Pure Love'', consisted of four sex scenes. 18 at the time, the shyness of her performance was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=1970|title=''Pure Love''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com/]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''18 Dream'' (August 1998) opens with Ozawa discussing her future in an interview, and while walking through streets and posing. The video continues with a scene in which Ozawa is fondled by an actor. The final third of the video has more interview, and moves on to a sex scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=1829|title=''18 Dreams''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com/]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Legend Of An AV Idol'' was a documentary-style AV describing Ozawa's adolescence, her early sex-life, and the story of how she became an AV queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=9A053|title=''Legend Of An AV Idol''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirements and come-backs==

Ozawa made more than one attempt to retire from performing in AVs. ''Requiem'' was touted as Ozawa's farewell video, though she returned to the industry not long after its release. This &quot;beautifully filmed&quot; video includes scenes of her meeting, chatting with and eventually engaging in sex with a fan. Their sex scene ends with the actress thanking the fan for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=2899|title=''Requiem''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com/]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another &quot;retirement&quot; AV was ''Fallen Angel X'', released in September 1999. The video featured Ozawa engaging in &quot;acrobatic&quot; sex scenes with multiple partners, and with her ex-boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=BZ26|title=''Fallen Angel X''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Ozawa made a come-back with the [[Moodyz]] company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/model.cfm?actress_filename=madoka_ozawa|title=Madoka Ozawa|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com/]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2003, Ozawa starred in another come-back AV, ''Look That Kill''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=LLL006|title=''LOOK THAT KILL''|accessdate=2007-08-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Taiwan and final retirement from AV==

In December 2002, Ozawa visited Taiwan for the first time in order to attend an automobile exhibition as a bikini model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taipei-Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Yun-Ping|last=Chang|title=Porn star out to prove she's not just a pretty face|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/03/09/197303|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=[[March 9]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2007-08-04|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her appearance at this event created such a stir with the public and media in Taiwan that she was invited for a second visit to appear before Taiwanese troops on [[Kinmen|Kinmen Island]], the first time an adult performer entertained the Taiwanese military. Magistrate Lee Chu-feng welcomed Ozawa and predicted that her visit to the island would boost tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taipei-Times&quot;/&gt; During this visit to Taiwan, Ozawa was invited to appear in the promotional campaign for Kaoliang Liquor, and to serve as a model in a wedding dress show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taipei-Times&quot;/&gt; 

In February and March of that year she was back in Taiwan participating in several entertainment and publicity events to heighten her public profile. She was offered opportunities to act in TV dramas, film, and to release popular music albums. With this increasing offer of mainstream work in Taiwan, Ozawa officially retired from adult videos in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taipei-Times&quot;/&gt;

Back in Japan, Ozawa's career was the subject of a 3-volume Classic/Memorial series of videos from Cosmos Plan in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=490|title=Madoka (Ozawa Madoka)|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===2002===
Ozawa made her AV debut in April 2002 with the Sexia label in the video ''My Birthday''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2002.htm|title=2002|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was noted in this premiere release for her &quot;beautiful D-cup breasts and... sexy face.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA265|title=''My Birthday''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was called &quot;one of the most beautiful of 2002&quot; in her second video, ''Love Story'' released the following month. She played the role of a high school girl suffering from amnesia who is raped in this Sexia Try Heart production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA268|title=''Love Story''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She entered the ''[[cosplay]]'' genre in ''Cosplasshion'' (June 2002). In this video she is worked on with a vibrator while in the costume of a nurse, a gangbanged while in cat girl costume, and engages in sex with her customers while dressed as a waitress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA273|title=''Naho Ozawa in Cosplasshion''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Sexy Teacher's Secret Spot'' (July 2002), Ozawa plays the role of a sex education teacher with a secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA273|title=''Sexy Teacher's Secret Spot''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her fifth video, ''I Wanna Suck'' (August 2002), allowed Ozawa to display her famous fellatio ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA281|title=''I Wanna Suck''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She demonstrates her technique on five actors, and the video includes some ''cosplay'' and a rape scene. The DVD, released the same month, included extra footage of Ozawa's first [[female ejaculation|ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SXD043|title=''I Wanna Suck''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Obscene Climax'' (September 2002) had Ozawa with ten male AV actors, and forced to follow the director's every order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obscene Climax&quot;/&gt; ''Sexia Milk'' from the same month had Ozawa teamed with a variety of AV actresses, including [[Aoi Minori]] in a school uniform and gym shorts-themed video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA284|title=''SEXIA MILK''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ozawa's seventh video, ''I Wanna See You'' (October 2002), was filmed entirely from the viewers' perspective, to give Ozawa's fans a chance to feel a closeness to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA289|title=''I Wanna See You''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Call Girl'', Ozawa's eighth release, had the actress in the role of a call girl engaging in baby talk and some aggressive sexual play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA293|title=''Call Girl''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Karami'', her ninth video, and her last for Sexia, Ozawa takes a trip with her filming crew, engages them in conversation and talk, and tries a lesbian scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA298|title=''Karami　Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her association with Sexia was concluded with year-end collections ''SEXIA Collection 2002'' and ''ALL That's SEXIA'', both of which paired her with fellow Sexia actress [[Asuka Sakamaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA296|title=''SEXIA Collection 2002''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SXD052|title=''ALL that's SEXIA''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her first year in the industry, Ozawa was awarded the 2002 [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2002 X City Grand Prix Awards|X City Grand Prix]] Best New Actress Award, which is given by AV fan vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night TV&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/programs/nighttv/about.html|title=About the Host|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/programs/nighttv/index.html Night TV hosted by Naho Ozawa]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003===
At the beginning of 2003, Ozawa ceased making videos exclusively with Sexia, and began working for various companies. At the Max-A studio she performed on their Samansa label. ''Sexy Teacher Hunt'' (January 2003), her first release for Samansa, had Ozawa playing the role of a teacher who is raped by her students who torture her and force her to perform fellatio on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2281|title=''Naho Ozawa in Sexy Teacher Hunt''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2003, Ozawa released her own entry in [[Alice Japan]]'s popular ''Sexy Butt'' series. This video featured Ozawa in school girl, race model and kimono dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV222|title=''Sexy Butt　Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2003, Ozawa formed the P.I.N. (Perfect Idol's Numbers) band with five other AV idols, [[Sayori Kamiya]], [[Cocolo]], [[Hitomi Hayasaka]], [[Rei Itoh]] and Natsuki. The group released an album and a video in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=NRO001|title=''P I N''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, Ozawa starred in her entry in Max-A's bondage and S/M-themed ''The Confined Bodydoll''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2287|title=''The Confined Bodydoll''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Alice Japan]]'s incest-genre video, ''Sexy Nurse Fucks Her Brother-in-Law'' (April 2003), Ozawa played the title role, a sexually frustrated wife and nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV237|title=''Sexy Nurse Fucks Her Brother-in-law''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Fuck Naho Ozawa'' (June 2003) had the actress playing three different types of prostitutes: A call girl, a high school girl and an S/M dominatrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV250|title=''Fuck Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''One Style'' also released in June 2003, Ozawa hitchikes in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=LLL005|title=''ONE STYLE　Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She played the role of a woman out for vengeance in ''Sexy Jaguar'' (August 2003). In this Try Heart release, Ozawa wears sexually attractive costumes to attract men who wronged her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA326|title=''Sexy Jaguar''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Max-A's ''Witch Hunt'' video series was initiated by [[Ami Ayukawa]] in August 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayukawa-witch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2236|title=''The Witch-Hunt''|accessdate=2007-06-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, Ozawa starred in the third entry in this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2304|title=''Witch Hunt 3''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept behind the series is to determine whether the model is a witch or not by submitting her to various forms of sexual torment and humiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayukawa-witch&quot;/&gt; A year later, in September 2004, [[Sora Aoi]] would follow Ozawa in the fourth entry of this series. It was claimed that &quot;Only charismatic actresses can star in this series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2358|title=''Witch Hunt IV''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Max-A's ''My Girl'' (November 2003), Ozawa takes her video crew to a hot springs resort, where all engage in sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2312|title=''my girl''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozawa's last release of 2003, ''The Tale of Miss R　Part2'' had her playing the part of a woman who is subservient to all men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2317|title=''The tale of Miss R　Part2''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004===
Ozawa's popularity was still high into the third year of her career, due to the uninhibited nature of her sex scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATURAL BORN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2321|title=''NATURAL BORN/Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; January 2004 found Ozawa back at Max-A for the video ''Samantha Naho Ozawa vol.3: House of Witch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XV156|title=''Samantha Naho Ozawa vol.3''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Natural Born'' released the same month, Ozawa talked about her career and personal life in the preliminary interview. The sex scenes in this video featured hand-held camera techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATURAL BORN&quot;/&gt;
''Naho Channel'' (February 2004) takes the idea of Ozawa appearing on every program on a TV channel's schedule to create some unusual sexual situations. Ozawa uses oil and a vibrator during a cooking show, wears no panties while reporting the weather, and engages in explicit sex during a daytime drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2325|title=''Naho Channel''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Mirage'' (April 2004) Ozawa and a male actor have sex in a bed surrounded by mirrors. The actress is shown watching herself receive ''[[bukkake]]'', and seeing her own sexual organs become aroused in the mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2333|title=''Mirage / Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Oral Infection'' (May 2004) allowed Ozawa to put her fellatio and other oral skills at the center of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2337|title=''Oral Infection / Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Persona'' is another oral-themed video. In this drama, Ozawa plays a woman who is constantly finding herself engaged in oral sex without remembering the events leading up to these encounters. She goes to an old factory to find the truth behind these events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2343|title=''Per Sona / Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another video with a mystery theme, ''Ugly Dream: The Fate of a Young Wife'' (July 2004), Ozawa plays the role of a newlywed woman who constantly dreams of being raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA386|title=''Ugly Dream / Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Shooting!'' (August 2004), Ozawa exposes herself in a public park, sexually attacks an AV actor, and then is assaulted by a middle-aged man with a vibrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2353|title=''SHOOTING! / Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Ozawa formed a group called L-Girls with five other AV idols, and released a DVD photo collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night TV&quot;/&gt;

About the time of the release of ''The Lewd Legs'' (September 2004), Ozawa's singing career was gaining popularity. In this video, Ozawa plays a doll and a lesbian queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA398|title=''The Lewd Legs　Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Naho's Horny Private Life'' purports to show a typical day in the actress's life with her boyfriend. The two take a bath together and engage in oral sex. They next go shopping for a vibrator, which Ozawa uses on herself after their date is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2363|title=''Naho's horny private life''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''New High School Teacher's Training: Memory of a Summer'' (November 2004), Ozawa plays a young woman who visits an old teacher she had a crush on as a girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=EDV0062|title=''New High School Teacher's Training''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stylish Sex'' (December 2004) has Ozawa in a school uniform and glasses, and she engages in a more aggressive sexual style than usual. The video concludes with her masturbating in front of ten men who then reciprocate the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2372|title=''Stylish Sex''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, Ozawa released a musical DVD and CD through the Sexual Kiss company entitled ''Little Lover''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2006-05-01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060501030405/sexualkiss.net/modules/tinyd1/index.php?id=2|url=http://sexualkiss.net/modules/tinyd1/index.php?id=2|title=Little Lover / 小沢菜穂|publisher=[http://sexualkiss.net/ Sexual Kiss Records official site]|accessdate=2009-03-08|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
Max-A chose to start 2005 out with a new series, and chose Naho Ozawa to star in the first video in that series. Entitled ''Welcome to Max Airline!'', the January release had Ozawa playing the role of a stewardess offering sex to her passengers during flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2377|title=''Welcome to Max Airline! Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozawa starred in ''The Naked &quot;MAPPA&quot;'', a non-pornographic nude-modeling &quot;image&quot; video the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SFLBK012|title=''The Naked &quot;MAPPA&quot; / Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2005 Ozawa starred in the second entry in Max-A's ''Night'' series. In this video, Ozawa engages in sex on two different nights for two different reasons. The first night, she is so lonely and in need of companionship, she pays for sex. On the second night she engages in sex out of physical pleasure on a balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2379|title=''Night / Naho''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''My History'' (April 2005) was Ozawa's last release for the Max-A label. An autobiographical drama, the video marked the end of her two year, four month association with the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2389|title=''My History / Naho Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-08-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozawa also hosted ''Night TV'', an adult cable show featuring interviews with fellow AV idols.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night TV&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nao Saejima'''|冴島奈緒|Saejima Nao}} is a Japanese [[AV idol]] and model of the 1980s and 1990s who also starred in [[photobooks]], [[V-Cinema]], and feature films, including [[Nikkatsu]]'s ''[[Roman Porno]]'' series. 

== Life and career ==
===AV career===
Nao Saejima was born in [[Tokyo]] on [[March 23]], [[1968]]. She began appearing as a gravure idol in 1985 and appeared on the nighttime TV variety show, ''11 P.M.'' in 1987. She made her AV debut with VIP in February of the same year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=RDA05123|title=''BEST 4 Hours / Nao Saejima''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English|quote='Nao Saejima' who debuted in 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ''No.1 F-Cup, Nao Saejima - Saejima's Awakening'' (冴島奈緒／FカップNo.1 奈緒の目覚め - ''Saejima Nao/F Kappu No. 1 Saejima no Mezame'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1987.htm|title=1987|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her slim figure and large breasts she quickly became a popular AV performer, appearing in at least 40 adult videos within two years of her debut.&lt;ref&gt;For a filmography of Saejima's Adult Videos, and theatrical and TV appearances, see the Japanese Wikipedia article&lt;/ref&gt; She ceased AV appearances for five years beginning in 1991. During this time she worked as a nude model while travelling between the United States and Japan. Her AV career resumed in 1996 and concluded with her retirement in 2002.

===Theatrical career===
Saejima appeared in one of Nikkatsu's last ''Roman Porno'' films in 1988. The studio ceased production of this long-running series of theatrical softcore porn films in 1988, and declared bankruptcy soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macias|first=Patrick|title=TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion|year=2001|publisher=Cadence Books|location=San Francisco|language=English|isbn=1-56931-681-3|pages=187-188|chapter=Nikkatsu's Roman Porno}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its Excess Films line, the studio continued to release theatrical pornography for several more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-88928-852-7|pages=p.63|quote=Nikkatsu... dumped money into a new &quot;B&quot; variation of the pinku eiga called Excess Films. With some exceptions, Excess was never taken seriously by the critics, although it managed to survive as an intermittent porn production studio - proudly lensing 35 mm pink films for at least another decade.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nao Saejima was hired by Excess Films to star in her own theatrical release, {{nihongo|''Abnormal Excitement: Nao Saejima''|冴島奈緒　異常昂奮|Saejima Nao: Ijo Kofun}} in 1989. Critical reaction to Saejima's performance was surprisingly positive, since AV performers were not thought capable of any genuine acting necessary for performing roles in theatrical films. This film has Saejima as a woman with the ability to communicate with the spirit world. She and her husband use this ability to swindle money out of grieving families of recently deceased. When the king of the spirit world learns of these shady practises, he kidnaps Saejima. Saejima's husband and a Chinese monk travel to the underworld to rescue her, encountering various bizarre sexual escapades on the way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-35&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among several other starring ''[[pink film]]'' and [[V-cinema]] roles in the 1990s, Saejima starred in Okura studio's {{nihongo|''Erotic Ghost Story: Female Ghost in Heat''|色欲怪談　発情女ゆうれい|Shikiyoku Kaidan: Hatsujo Onna Yurei}} ([[1995 in film|1995]]). In this supernatural  sex-thriller she plays the role of the wife of a doctor who is haunted by a sex-hungry female spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Satoru Kobayashi (director)|Satoru Kobayashi]], the director of the first ''pink film'', ''[[Flesh Market]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|id=0286091|title=Shikiyoku kaidan: hatsujo onna yurei (1995)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Saejima's proven acting ability in these theatrical ''pink films'', cult director [[Hisayasu Sato]] chose her for a major role in his second mainstream film, ''Meet Me In The Dream: Wonderland'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-35&quot;/&gt; The prolific Sato's last film for over a year, it was based on Naoki Yamamoto's ''[[manga]]'' about a woman with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wc03.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:249621|title=Apartment Wife: Mid-Afternoon Love Affair|accessdate=2007-09-11|last=Firsching|first=Robert|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
A woman of many talents, during her AV and acting career Saejima also worked as a writer, a rock group vocalist, and a beauty counselor. After her retirement from public appearances in 2002 it was reported that she was working as an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060305001357/mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|archivedate=2006-03-05|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|title=Porn starlets move on to inspiring second careers|date=[[January 7]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-06-04|language=English|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a sign of Saejima's international popularity, the Taiwan rock band, Goodbye!Nao! was named in tribute to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Events &amp; Entertainment|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2006/06/23/2003315200|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=[[June 23]], [[2006]]|page=p.14|accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Asuka Sakamaki'''|坂巻あすか|Sakamaki Asuka}} is a popular [[Japan]]ese [[AV idol]] from [[Tokyo]] who was born on [[October 8]], [[1982]]. 
==AV career==

Sakamaki made her AV debut in May 2002 in the video ''First Class'' for [[Sexia]]'s &quot;Try Heart&quot; label,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2002.htm|title=2002|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the label under which she has continued to appear in many videos. her debut video employed the concept of having the actress go for one month without masturbating. It is claimed that she normally masturbates daily. After the month-long abstinence, viewers are invited to witness the actress become &quot;a wild sex animal&quot;. Sakamaki's performance in this video had commentators predicting she would rise to the top of the AV field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA270|title=''First class''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third video, ''The Sensation'' (July 2002), employed elements of the &quot;image&quot; video (non-pornographic nude modeling), and hardcore sex scenes. The sex scenes included fellatio in a car, rape while blindfolded and oil massage. The &quot;image&quot; video scenes included a swimsuit modeling session, and a maid costume section.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sensation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SXD041|title=''The Sensation''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakamaki's entry in Sexia's popular ''Sexy Teacher's Secret Spot'' series (September 2002), employed a traditional fictional narrative, similar to early AVs and their ''[[pink film]]'' predecessors. The story had Sakamaki as a sex-hungry teacher who seduces both her students and her co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA286|title=''Sexy Teacher's Secret Spot''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her performance in this video was selected to be included in the &quot;best of&quot; the series collection, ''Sexy Teacher's Secret Spot BEST SELECTION Vol.1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA372|title=''Sexy Teacher's Secret Spot BEST SELECTION Vol.1''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Wanna Suck'' from October, 2002, returned to the ''cosplay'' genre, with Sakamaki wearing tights, a doctor's uniform, Chinese costume and lingerie. As the title implies, the video also features scenes fellatio, which she performs on more than ten actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SXD048|title=''I Wanna Suck　Asuka Sakamaki''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the omnibus videos, ''ALL that's SEXIA'' and ''SEXIA Collection 2002'', highlights of Sakamaki's videos for Sexia during the year were combined with other stars for the company, including [[Naho Ozawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA296|title=''SEXIA Collection 2002''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SXD052|title=''ALL that's SEXIA''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cosplasshin'' (August 2002) focused entirely on the ''[[cosplay]]'' genre. The uniforms worn by Sakamaki in this video included those of a school girl, a bunny, Chinese costume, a nurse's uniform and ''[[kimono]]''. Sakamaki engages in three-partner sex while wearing the traditional Japanese costume.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sensation&quot;/&gt;

After a break from the industry beginning in 2003, she returned for the 2006 video, ''Falling Logic'' for the Kasakura Publishing label. In this one-time come-back video, Sakamaki donned a maid's costume in which she served her master and other male actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=NOV1067|title=''Falling Logic / Asuka Sakamaki''|accessdate=2007-08-02|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asuka Sakamaki is also notably prolific for a Japanese AV actress. The average career of an AV actress in Japan spans about one year, during which the actress will appear in five to ten videos total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-08-02|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|publisher= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate =2007-03-20|quote=If she’s only out for money, she will studiously avoid publicity and quit inside a year—the average life-span of an AV girl—with five or ten videos to her credit and an unknowing family bosom to return to.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakamaki's career has spanned over four years during which she has appeared in at least 29 video items and three photo books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.co.jp/s?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;initialSearch=1&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%8D%E2%8A%AA%82%A0%82%B7%82%A9 Amazon search] on 坂巻あすか (Sakamaki Asuka), conducted [[August 2]], [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Miki Sawaguchi'''|沢口みき|Sawaguchi Miki}}, born [[September 1]], [[1975]] in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]]) is one of Japan's best known [[adult video]] performers, known especially for her large breasts (metric bra size of 70J or 32G in North American sizing). On television she has appeared as a regular cast member on two shows and made several guest appearances on other shows. She has also appeared on radio and made two musical CDs. Her principal work, however, are the countless adult VHS and DVD films in which she has appeared. 

==Early life==
Prior to her career as an adult entertainer, Sawaguchi was employed at both a coffee shop and a clothing store. She also worked for a private tutoring center.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoismiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mikisawaguchi.com/about/who-is-miki-sawaguchi.html|title=Who is Miki Sawaguchi|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://www.mikisawaguchi.com mikisawaguchi.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming that she has always loved to be photographed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/B_OPEN/Profile/miki/interv.html|title=Miki Sawaguchi Interview|accessdate=2007-06-09|language=?|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ XCity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; she entered the adult film business in 1996.

== JAV Debut ==
In a country where [[AV idol]]s can become major celebrities, Miki Sawaguchi quickly gained many fans, and became a presence in the mainstream Japanese media. She rose to stardom in the 1990s, soon becoming one of the most popular Japanese big-bust adult video stars in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoismiki&quot;/&gt; Miki made her porno debut in 1996 with a video entitled {{nihongo|''I Have Found Breasts Larger Than My Face''|顔よりデカイの見っけ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1996.htm|title=1996|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video saw her partake in three sex scenes said to be inspired by her real-life love making experiences during and after high school. In an interview on that video Miki says that she was very shy during her first sexual encounter, and had to be guided throughout most of it by her much older partner.

One of Miki Sawaguchi's most successful videos was released in 1997 entitled ''Ultra Breasts''. Its cover features a vintage picture of Miki in a small blue bikini, and it has become a collector's item in and outside of Japan in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://auction.yahoo.co.jp|title=yahoo japan|publisher=[http://auction.yahoo.co.jp Yahoo Japan Auctions]|accessdate=2006-03-21 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This third production of hers features, again, three sex scenes, where this time Miki is dominated by her different sex partners. This popular and patriarchal performance style of Miki Sawaguchi is what has defined her as a JAV idol throughout her career.

== First Retirement ==
With Miki Sawaguchi's booming popularity as an adult actress/idol in 1997, the Osaka-based comedian talent agency [[Yoshimoto Kogyo]] convinced Sawaguchi to retire from the JAV industry and become a media personality. Such a move was risky considering Sawaguchi's background in porno and the negative influence she might have on children, but the agency was convinced she could pull it off. By 1997, Miki had already had success as a bikini model in weekly magazines and as a piece of eye candy on adult-themed TV shows, so there was nothing to convince Yoshimoto Kogyo otherwise.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} For a short time, in 1998, Miki Sawaguchi held her own radio program and was a guest on several talkshows, like ''Downtown DX''.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

== Second JAV Debut ==
In 1998, Miki Sawaguchi made her official return to the JAV industry with the production of ''Come Back to Ultra Breasts''. In her opening speech within this video, she describes the Japanese media/entertainment industry as a &quot;dark and dirty world&quot; that unheartedly destroys people's careers. In contrast, Miki describes the porno industry as a place she feels right &quot;at home.&quot;{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

Throughout all of Miki Sawaguchi's productions following her return to porno, it is apparent that her short time in the media spotlight has enabled her to atriculate herself to a higher degree than in her earlier work. In most of Miki's post-1998 work, she often gives heartfelt speeches to her audience regarding her personal life and her views on sexual intimacy as well. For instance, in ''White Princess'', she explains to us that all of her experinces having sex on film have driven her to develop sexual techniques that can fully satisfy her on-screen partners.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The summer, 1999 issue of the U.S. magazine ''Oriental Cinema'' featured a review of Miki Sawaguchi's video, ''101 CM: J-Cup'', with images of Ms. Sawaguchi on the front, back and inside covers. The reviewer calls her video, ''101 CM: J-Cup'', &quot;the best X-rated Japanese video I've ever seen...&quot;, further stating, &quot;Miki Sawaguchi one of the sexiest women in Japan.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Foster, Damon. 1999. ''101 CM: J-Cup'' review in ''Oriental Cinema'' #16 (Summer, 1999), p.39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following her second debut, Miki Sawaguchi also attempted to fulfill her dream of having a musical career. Already an established multi-media star in Japan by 1999, she entered the music industry by releasing her own album, entitled, ''Big Boobs'', on the Alchemy Records label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00005EYV7|title=(''Big Boobs'')|accessdate=2007-06-09|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last song on the album, ''Watashi no Mune de Onemurinasai'' (&quot;Sleep with Your Head in My Chest&quot;), was also the subtitle of the album. The album was successful enough for her to contribute vocals on a second Alchemy release entitled ''Uterus and Human''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00005HOIW|title=(''Uterus and Human'')|accessdate=2007-06-09|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With her guitar noise band, Sawaguchi performed in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Knitting Factory]] on [[November 18]], [[2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=POP AND JAZZ GUIDE: HIJOKAIDAN+SOLMANIA+MIKI SAWAGUCHI, BORBETOMAGUS|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/17/movies/pop-and-jazz-guide-235571.html?pagewanted=3|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2000-11-17|accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third Debut ==
Miki Sawaguchi is currently working infrequently on the JAV scene, making a few videos befitting her &quot;jukujo&quot; (mature lady) status, such as the 2004 release, ''Remembrance of Lewd Tits''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KK009|title=''Remembrance of Lewd Tits''|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|quote=Enjoy a mature woman's indecent scenes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of videos for the &quot;mature woman&quot; specialist studio [[Madonna (studio)|Madonna]]. In August 2006, Sawaguchi started an online diary which she continues to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/anton91/archives/2006-08.html|title=沢口みき公式ブログ「ニャンコな日々」: 沢口みきのニャンコのようにのんびりな日々の日記です☆|accessdate=2008-06-22|publisher=[http://blog.livedoor.jp/ blog.livedoor.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven years after her AV debut, ''Tokyo Topless'', a Japanese big-bust website which is updated about once a month, gave Sawaguchi her seventh featured appearance on [[April 27]], [[2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tokyotopless.com/model/MikiSAWAGUCHI/07/|title=Miki SAWAGUCHI|accessdate=2007-05-03|publisher=tokyotopless.com|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; This site also informs us that Miki has become a part-time prostitute at a [[soap land]] in Tokyo. The club's site does promote her as a J-cup former AV star, but lists her age four years younger than she actually is.

{{nihongo|'''Sakura Sena'''|瀬名 さくら|Sena Sakura|January 31, 1975}} is a big-busted [[Japan]]ese [[glamour model]] and [[adult actress]] known for her [[brassiere measurements|32 G]] cup breasts and 23&quot; waist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Sena|first=Sakura|url=http://www.babes.net/biography.asp?ID=2315|title= Biography - Sena Sakura|accessdate=2007-05-03|publisher=Babes.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sena was born January 31, 1975 to a middle-class family in [[Chigasaki, Kanagawa|Chigasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. Her father was a carpenter, and she had two older brothers and one younger brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt; Sexually precocious from an early age, Sena's first exposure to pornography was at the age of 13 when she secretly viewed a hardcore American video in her father's collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt; She attributes her preference for foreign men to this experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_75.html|last=Woo|first=Ex-S (translator)|date=[[2003-11-27]]|title=Sakura Sena (Interview)|accessdate=2007-04-23|quote=Well, you do have to understand that I have a big thing for foreign guys. They're all that come into my sights... it's probably because the first porn I saw was a hardcore American one.|publisher=Jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of her father's videos inspired Sena to begin masturbating with a [[vacuum cleaner]]. She recalls, &quot;I eventually did it so hard that my skin ripped and blood was going everywhere. That's when my grandfather came in... he saw me against the wall, my legs spread apart wide and a vacuum cleaner hose in my pussy. He just told me that I had a phone call and left... He looked too embarrassed to say anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_JMate_Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_75.html|last=Woo|first=Ex-S (translator)|date=[[2003-11-27]]|title=Sakura Sena (Interview)|accessdate=2007-04-23|publisher=Jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sena lost her virginity while still a 14 year old junior-high school student. During this time she gained sexual experience through encounters with older men, including her friends' fathers, whom she credits for teaching her about sex toys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_JMate_Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_75.html|last=Woo|first=Ex-S (translator)|date=[[2003-11-27]]|title=Sakura Sena (Interview)|accessdate=2007-04-23|quote=...with my friends' fathers and people like that... The older guys taught me a lot, especially when it came to sex toys.|publisher=Jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a year after her first sexual encounter, she was picked up by members of the ''[[yakuza]]''. The gang took her to a [[love hotel]], where other men were waiting. She was forced to give [[fellatio]] to members of the gang for two hours. This encounter, to which she credits her oral skills, was followed by a [[karaoke]] session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt;

===Career===
Sena had always intended to do something out of the ordinary with her life, at first planning to go to design school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt; In her late teens, Sena began her career as a nude model, posing for magazine photos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt; In October 1994 at the age of 19, she made her [[Japanese film]] debut in the porno movie ''Kaikin'' using her stage name of  {{nihongo|Shiho Fujiwara|藤原 史歩|Fujiwara Shiho}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asiansirens&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asian-sirens.com/models/sakura/index.html|title=Sakura Sena - The Japanese Bomb!|publisher=[http://www.asian-sirens.com/ www.asian-sirens.com]|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2002-debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2002.htm|title=2002|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made her stage debut as a stripper in May 1995 and by October 1995 was modeling for the S&amp;M magazine ''Bishojo SM Sashinsu''.&lt;ref name=&quot;asiansirens&quot;/&gt; In May 1995 she had also appeared in director [[Yutaka Ikejima]]'s [[pink film]] {{nihongo|''Molester's Train: Molester Techniques''|痴漢電車　痴漢のテクニック|Chikan Densha Chikan No Tekunikku}}, part of the long-running ''Molester's Train'' series produced by [[Shintoho]] and started by [[Academy Award]]-winning director [[Yōjirō Takita]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1995/ds001110.htm|title=痴漢電車　痴漢のテクニック|accessdate=2009-06-24|publisher=[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/ JMDB]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|pages=276-277|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-889288-52-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After almost four years of working as an [[erotic dancer]] in [[strip tease]] and in several adult films, Sena decided to have an image change. Up to this point, her bust measurement had been an 85&amp;nbsp;cm metric C cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?AID=330|title=Shiho (Fujiwara Shiho)|accessdate=2007-06-06|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sena decided to have her [[breast]]s enhanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt; Starting with a 400&amp;nbsp;cc under the muscle boob job in Japan and then in a second breast enhancement of 1000&amp;nbsp;cc saline over the muscle at [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], [[United States|U.S.]]{{Fact|date=June 2009}} These very large 32&quot; G [[Brassiere#Bra sizes|cup size]] breasts prompted the Japanese media to nickname her ''Cyborg Woman''.{{Fact|date=June 2009}} In September 1999, mostly due to the then blooming adult Internet boom in Japan, Sena became a pioneering Japanese adult entertainer when marketing herself in a single-model website promotion.{{Fact|date=June 2009}}

She made her first post-operative appearance, and her international debut, in the December 1999 issue of the American skin magazine ''[[Score (magazine)|Score]]'', the first Japanese woman featured in that magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt; In 2001, she contracted to work with a foreign cast in the [[JAV]]-produced [[pornography|porn]] DVD, ''Monster Body'', released in March 2002 under the Princess label.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002-debut&quot;/&gt; Three other videos were also released by Princess starring Sena, ''Sakura Sena - Japanese Girl'' and two volumes of ''Sakura Sena -Sex Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkikaku.jp/b/s103.4.5.6.7.8.htm|title=瀬名　さくら(超巨乳)|publisher=[http://www.nkikaku.jp/ www.nkikaku.jp]|accessdate=2009-06-24|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her website is titled Sakura Mania Club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babes.net/resume.asp?ID=2315|title= Resume - Sena Sakura|accessdate=2007-05-03|publisher=Babes.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a.k.a. SMC). When interviewed in 2003, Sena stated that she had a Canadian boyfriend of German descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_JMate_Interview&quot;/&gt; Since May 2003 Sena has lived in the [[Okanagan Valley]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakura_Sena_Babes_biography&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Naomi Tani'''|谷ナオミ|Tani Naomi}} is a Japanese actress who is best known for her appearances in [[Nikkatsu]]'s [[Roman Porno]] films with an [[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]] theme during the 1970s. 

==Life and career==
===Early career===
Born [[October 20]], [[1948]] in the [[Hakata-ku, Fukuoka|Hakata]] ward of [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]], Naomi Tani moved to [[Tokyo]] at the age of 18. After arrival in Tokyo, she was featured in a photo layout in ''Weekly Taishu / Popular Weekly'' (週刊大衆 - ''Shukan Taishu'')&lt;ref&gt;Tani, Naomi. Interviewed by Hamamoto, Maki. (1998). &quot;Naomi Tani - An Interview with Nikkatsu's Queen of SM&quot; (Conducted in January 1998 in Kyushu, Japan) in ''Asian Cult Cinema'' Number 19, April 1998. p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;. This appearance led to offers for roles in &quot;[[Pink film]]s&quot;, the low-budget, independent soft-core pornographic films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema at this time. Her debut was in the 1967 film ''Special''. She took her screen name &quot;Tani&quot; from the novelist [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]] and &quot;Naomi&quot; from the central character in his important early work ''[[Naomi (novel)|A Fool's Love]]''. &quot;Tani,&quot; or &quot;valley,&quot; is also a Japanese slang word for the cleavage between the breasts. Consequently, Ms. Tani may have had a variety of puns in mind when she later opened a restaurant calling it the &quot;Ohtani&quot; (Big Breasts or Big Tani).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-889288-52-7|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tani's early films were principally with the small companies that were making ''pink films'' independent of the large studio system in the 1960s. In her pre-Nikkatsu career, she appeared in comedies, dramas, and action films, but it was the S&amp;M genre which would make Tani a star. Her debut film was ''Special'' (スペシャル - ''Supesharu'') for Shin Nihon Eigasha and directed by the prolific ''pink film'' auteur [[Kōji Seki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citwf.com/film66742.htm|title=''Supesharu / Special''|accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=[http://www.citwf.com/ Complete Index to World Film]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had Tani in the role of the mistress of a black marketeer who tries to cheat people at an ''[[onsen]]''. The couple is stopped by the local villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowie|first=Peter (editor)|title=World Filmography 1967|year=1977|publisher=Tantivy Press|location=London|isbn=0-498015-65-3|chapter=Japan|page=411.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Experiments on the Human Body'' (''Zanki: Seitaijikken'' 1967) was a war drama in which Tani played a nurse in China where Japanese doctors are performing experiments on Chinese POWs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowie|first=Peter (editor)|title=World Filmography 1967|year=1977|publisher=Tantivy Press|location=London|isbn=0-498015-65-3|chapter=Japan|page=422.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tani's first experience with an S&amp;M film was in one episode of the omnibus film ''Memoirs Of A Modern Female Doctor'' (1967),&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, 269.&lt;/ref&gt; and her first full-fledged S&amp;M leading role was in director Masanao Sakao's ''Female Bodies in a Brutal Scenario'' (1967), in which she plays a prostitute who repeatedly escapes from, and then captured and tortured by the ''[[yakuza]]''. Tani would play similar roles for Sakao in other films such as ''Virgins With Bad Reputations'', also made in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Tani had a minor role in director [[Mamoru Watanabe]]'s ''[[Slave Widow]]'', which starred major &quot;pink&quot; actresses Noriko Tatsumi and Mari lwai. Impressed with Tani, Watanabe, considered one of the &quot;Pillars of Pink,&quot; cast Tani in her first leading role for his next film, ''Bed of Violent Desires'' (1967). Typical of the sex-thriller ''pink films'' made by Koei studio in the years before Nikkatsu took over the genre in the 1970s, in this film, Tani plays the role of a daughter who seeks bloody revenge against her mother and her lover after they kill Tani's father for his money.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.62, 394-395.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this early stage of her career, Tani sometimes worked at prominent ''pink film'' producer/director [[Kōji Wakamatsu]]'s independent studio. She worked several times with the prolific director [[Shinya Yamamoto]] in such films as ''Degenerate'' (1967), ''Memoirs Of Modern Love: Curious Age'' (1967) and ''Season For Rapists'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this period she became friends with the SM author, [[Oniroku Dan]], with whom she would work throughout her film career. Dan was secretly writing S&amp;M film scripts under the pseudonym Matsugoro Kuroiwa while working as a high school English teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Tani (Interview), p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; Tani's &quot;pretty face, beautiful fair skin... and 96cm (38&quot;) large breasts&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/N_TANI/index.html|title=Naomi Tani|accessdate=2007-03-03|language=English|publisher=xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as her acting abilities helped make her a popular actress in the late 1960s. She reportedly appeared in more than 200 films before her work with Nikkatsu, for which she is best known today.&lt;ref&gt; Weisser, p.333.&lt;/ref&gt; Even at this early stage of her career, working for independent studios, Tani had already established herself as the &quot;Queen of Pink.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Konuma-22&quot;&gt;Konuma, Masaru. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser on November 6, 1998, in ''Asian Cult Cinema'', #22, 1st Quarter, 1999. p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; As an indication of her growing prominence as a representative of the erotic cinema in Japan, she appeared in the U.S. ''[[Playboy]]'s'' December 1968 issue in their &quot;Girls of the Orient&quot; pictorial article.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPlayboy-1968&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Crossett|first=Andrew|url=http://www.aeolia.net/playboy/pb-t.htm|title=The Playboy Index - T|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=[http://www.aeolia.net/playboy/playboy.htm Index: The Women of Playboy – 1967 &amp;ndash; 2007]|year=2007|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, she directed two films from Oniroku Dan stories, ''Sex Killer'' and ''Starved Sex Beast''. Commenting on her own directorial style, Tani noted, &quot;I accentuated scenes with a lot of torture and bondage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tani (Interview), p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nikkatsu===
Throughout the 1960s, softcore pornographic &quot;Pink Films&quot; had been produced in Japan by small, independent studios. In 1971, however, Nikkatsu, the country's oldest film studio, had entered the &quot;Pink Film&quot; market with its high-budget and quality &quot;Roman Porno&quot; series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macias|first=Patrick|title=TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion|year=2001|publisher=Cadence Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-56931-681-3|oclc= |pages=187–188|chapter=Nikkatsu's Roman Porno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides appearing in Nikkatsu's first experiment in the ''pink film'' in 1968, ''Tokyo Bathhouse'' (''Onna Ukiyo Buro''), which featured over 30 sex-film stars in cameo appearances,&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.434.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''World Filmography 1968'', p.411.&lt;/ref&gt; Tani's first official ''Roman porno'' for Nikkatsu was in a minor role as a nurse in ''Sensuous Beasts'' (1972). Unlike her starring roles for smaller studios, she played a supporting role in this film. Preferring to continue starring in lower-budget films rather than playing supporting roles for Nikkatsu's leading Roman Porno actresses, she did not stay with Nikkatsu at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Tani (Interview), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.374-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when Nikkatsu began asking Tani to work for their studio in major roles, she refused for years because Nikkatsu was reluctant to enter the S&amp;M genre with its ''Roman Porno'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Konuma-22&quot;/&gt; Feeling that S&amp;M was her destiny, Tani consented to work at Nikkatsu only on the condition that her first film be based on Oniroku Dan's novel, ''[[Flower and Snake]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Konuma-22&quot;/&gt; Nikkatsu agreed. Directed by [[Masaru Konuma]], this 1974 film became a major hit for Nikkatsu, and established the S&amp;M genre of Roman Porno film which would continue to be profitable for the studio throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. 

Tani's next film for Nikkatsu, ''[[Wife to be Sacrificed]]'' (1974) was also directed by Konuma, though, unlike most of her films for the studio, this one was not based on an Oniroku Dan novel. It became an even bigger hit than ''Flower and Snake'', and one of Nikkatsu's all-time top five money-makers. Tani's female co-star from ''Wife to be Sacrificed'', Terumi Azuma, would return in the 1975 film, ''[[Cruelty: Black Rose Torture]]'', and the two would be paired in several other films until Azuma began starring in her own films in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; The title introduced Nikkatsu's nickname for Tani (&quot;Black Rose&quot;), which would be re-used in later film titles.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; In Konuma's 1977 parody of the ''Roman porn'' genre, ''In the Realm of Sex'', Tani appears as herself, stalked by a perverted middle-aged fan who wants to perform an S&amp;M session with her. Tani manages to reverse the roles by binding and torturing the fan instead.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Konuma, Tani worked for many of the other most prominent ''Roman porno'' directors while at Nikkatsu. &quot;Violent pink&quot; director [[Yasuharu Hasebe]] commented, &quot;I regret that I only worked with her once... a very short scene at a greenhouse in ''Rape!'' The segment was only long enough for her to get assaulted by the rapist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hasebe, Yasuharu. (1999). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser in Tokyo. ''Asian Cult Cinema'' #25, 4th Quarter 1999, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; Tani starred in director [[Koyū Ohara]]'s Nikkatsu ''Roman pornos'', ''[[Fascination: Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1977), ''[[Rope Hell]]'' (1978) and ''[[Fairy in a Cage]]'' (1977) which had Tani playing the role of a wealthy business woman who is tortured by the sadistic head of the inquisition branch of the Japanese military during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.136-138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Director [[Shōgorō Nishimura]]'s 1978 film, ''[[Lady Black Rose]]'', contained two notorious scenes which are often selected as examples of the ''Roman porno'' S&amp;M genre. In one, gallons of water are forced into Tani's mouth through a funnel while her stomach can be seen enlarging. Tani points out that scenes like these were often tricks, though no special effects were involved. &quot;I was simply good at sucking my belly into a small ball and then expanding it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tani (Interview), p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the other, gallons of brandy are similarly poured into Tani's vagina while her body can be seen flushing from pale white to a drunken red. The film is alternately praised and condemned as &quot;the ultimate woman-as-an-object&quot; film.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Tani's last film, ''[[Rope and Skin]]'' (1979) was also directed by Nishimura, once again based on an Oniroku Dan novel, and had a part for fellow &quot;Pink queen,&quot; [[Junko Miyashita]]. As Tani's farewell performance, Nikkatsu gave this critically-acclaimed yakuza period-piece a big budget.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tani's style===
Known for her remarkable dedication to her work, Tani would perform even the most extreme of S&amp;M scenes without complaint. During the twelve years she worked as an actress, she never went to the beach or allowed herself to get a suntan, feeling that it was important to keep her skin very white, so that it could be seen turning red during some of the scenes involving such things as whippings or melting candle wax tortures.&lt;ref&gt;Tani (Interview), p.43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Tani wrote in 1998 &quot;The woman's naked body must not only be seen as a sensual object, but must also be able to express emotion; so, I did my best to keep Naomi Tani's body as close as possible to perfect condition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction-9&quot;&gt;Tani, Naomi. (1998) &quot;Introduction&quot; in Weisser, ''Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Tani was asked if she ever found herself sexually aroused while making a film, she stressed the artistry behind her performances, commenting that the face of a woman in actual sexual ecstacy would likely cause laughter. Instead, she says, &quot;An actress has the responsibility to excite the audience, not herself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tani (Interview), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; She further states, &quot;... to gain sympathy from the audience, I engaged in elaborate discussions with the filmmakers concerning Naomi Tani's torture scenes, to insure that they were both cruel and beautiful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tani (&quot;Introduction&quot;), p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Her willingness to submit herself to scenes of extreme physical difficulty led director Shinya Yamamoto to famously utter, &quot;Naomi Tani is a monster!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tani (Interview), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of her performances was recognized by the mainstream Japanese film establishment. She was nominated for best actress by the [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japanese Academy]] for two of her Nikkatsu ''Roman Porno'' films, ''Black Rose Ascending'' (1975),&lt;ref name=&quot;Tani_Interview_46&quot;&gt;Tani (Interview), p.46&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Flesh of the Rose'', (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0849437/awards|title=Awards for Naomi Tani|accessdate=2007-03-03|publisher=[[IMDB]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Masaru Konuma says as an actress Tani was, &quot;Stylish. No matter what she did-- her behavior, her attitude, her body-- everything became a perfect picture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Konuma, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Behind the Mask: On Sexual Demons, Sacred Mothers, Transvestites, Gangsters, Drifters, and Other Japanese Cultural Heroes'', [[Ian Buruma]] describes Tani as the most celebrated porn star of her time, &quot;combin[ing] the savage and the maternal.&quot; To explain her popularity he says she &quot;looked like a Japanese mother, her ample breasts tucked into a matronly kimono. She was the ideal object for men to take their anxieties out in, like the patient mother being pummelled by her sons. She was the Mother Goddess in bondage, the passive cross-bearer of masculine inadequacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buruma|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Buruma|title=Behind the Mask: On Sexual Demons, Sacred Mothers, Transvestites, Gangsters, Drifters, and Other Japanese Cultural Heroes|chapter=Demon Woman|pages=61–62|year=1984|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=Seattle, WA|isbn=0-39453-775-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
In 1979, after reigning for five years as Nikkatsu's &quot;Queen Of S&amp;M,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildjapan.co.uk/pinku.php|title=Japanese &quot;Pink Eiga&quot; - A Short History Of The Japanese Sex Film Of The 1970s|accessdate=2007-02-18 |last=Chinchen|first=Jonny|year=2004|publisher=www.wildjapan.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tani retired suddenly and unexpectedly at the height of her popularity. She later gave her reason as, &quot;I never wanted to disappoint my fans by showing an unflattering face. That's why I've always refused to do a ''comeback''. Nobody is free from aging. I want to exist in the audience's memory as a ''forever blooming flower''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Weisser, p.333 &lt;/ref&gt; 

She celebrated her retirement by issuing a vocal album entitled ''Modae no Heya.'' On this disc's recent re-release in CD format, a reviewer commented of Tani's vocals, &quot;There’s a worldliness in her voice and a maturity which suggests she’s seen it all... There is however a fragility to her voice, a cracking sense of the truly erotic, the unseen, the taboo which drapes each syllable... hearing music which would usually be readily associated with a mid-70s Samurai movie bedding down with such muted eroticism is more than a winning formula.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=25412|title=TANI NAOMI - Modae No Heya|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=www.boomkat.com|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tani notes that she immediately felt much more relaxed upon retirement. &quot;I didn't have to worry about going out in the sun. I could suddenly enjoy the outdoors, golf and the beach.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tani_Interview_46&quot;/&gt; Her early retirement from film was clouded by difficulty however. In 1981 she was hit by a car while walking her dog, and had to undergo extensive rehabilitation for three years. This difficult period in her life continued with her 1984 divorce from her husband. After the divorce, she opened the Ohtani restaurant in [[Kumamoto, Kumamoto|Kumamoto]], which became highly successful, and which she currently owns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tani_Interview_47&quot;&gt;Tani (Interview), p.47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 she also opened &quot;Yours Naomi&quot;, a video store near Hakata which specializes in erotic cinema, especially Nikkatsu's Roman Porno films. She comments that &quot;Many young people (in their 20s and 30s) who used to buy the mindless AV [Adult Video] junk have shifted to 'Roman Porn' after being introduced to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tani_Interview_47&quot;/&gt; 

During the late 1990s Tani's work enjoyed a renewed surge of interest. ''Wife to be Sacrificed'' was released theatrically in the U.S. in 1998, playing in [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranaletta, Ray. (1998). &quot;Wife to be Sacrificed - Coming to a Theater Near You?&quot; in ''Asian Cult Cinema'', # 19 (April 1998), p.49-50&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for this event, Tani was interviewed by the U.S. publication, ''Asian Cult Cinema'' for its April, 1998 issue. Surprised by this attention from the U.S., Tani commented &quot;I didn't think U.S. movie fans were interested in me or my movies. I thought Americans ignored my films because of the SM theme, since these movies give the impression of being abusive toward women. Regardless of the filmmaker's intent - the intellectual or artistic merit - I thought Americans viewed these productions as politically incorrect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction-9&quot;/&gt;

This attention from the U.S. again brought Tani to the attention of the domestic Japanese media. At the time, Tani wrote, &quot;the fact that people are still interested in me - after almost 20 years away from the screen - fills me with buoyancy and surprise. It embarrasses me, too.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction-9&quot;/&gt; In this retrospective atmosphere, Tani was finally persuaded to return to film in 2000 to appear in [[Hideo Nakata]]'s documentary on director Masaru Konuma entitled ''Sadistic and Masochistic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemasie.com/fr/fiche/personne/taninaomi/portrait.html|title=TANI Naomi|accessdate=2007-03-03|language=French|publisher=www.cinemasie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Maki Tomoda'''|友田真希|Tomoda Maki|born [[August 20]], [[1972]]}} is an award-winning [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[actress]] who is best known for her appearances in [[pornographic film|adult video]]s, cementing her status as an [[AV idol]].

==Life and career==
Making her AV debut in 2002, after her 30th birthday, Tomoda's prolific career (including 323 DVD appearances currently listed at Amazon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%8F%8B%E7%94%B0%E7%9C%9F%E5%B8%8C/s/qid=1220681593/ref=sr_nr_i_0?ie=UTF8&amp;rs=&amp;keywords=%E5%8F%8B%E7%94%B0%E7%9C%9F%E5%B8%8C&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A%E5%8F%8B%E7%94%B0%E7%9C%9F%E5%B8%8C%2Ci%3Advd] search at amazon.co.jp [[September 5]], [[2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;) reflects the growing market for &quot;mature woman&quot; or &quot;madame&quot; (熟女 = jukujo) actresses which appeared in the AV marketplace in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/S_SHINOZAKI/index.html|title=Satomi Shinozaki biography|accessdate=2007-02-18 |format= |work=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/ Shin-Toho History]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, along with Mayumi Kusunoki and [[Aki Tomosaki]], Tomoda appeared in the premier DVD issued by [[Madonna (studio)|Madonna]] (''Man-Eating Mature Women - Semen Squeezing'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madonna-av.com/works/-/detail/=/cid=juk001/|title=男喰い熟女 ザーメン搾り|accessdate=2008-09-20|publisher=[http://www.madonna-av.com/ www.madonna-av.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an AV studio specializing in &quot;mature women&quot;. She continued to make about one movie a month for Madonna up to the beginning of 2005.

Tomoda has been increasingly seen in productions involving [[sado-masochism]] in recent years, including a number of videos with the Japanese AV studio [[Dogma studio|Dogma]], known for its extreme fetish videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=89|title=JAV News - Popular Series and Actors from Dogma Studio|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]|month=August |year=2008|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She initiated director and Dogma founder [[TOHJIRO]]'s extreme &quot;CORE&quot; series with ''Maki Tomoda - Bound Masochistic Slave''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=COT-001&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=&amp;next=10|title=Maki Tomoda - COT-001|accessdate=2008-09-22|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another Dogma video, ''Anal Trance DX - Maki Tomoda'', she undergoes &quot;basic training to get over her fear of anal penetration&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=DDT-158&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=&amp;next=1|title=Anal Trance DX|accessdate=2008-09-22|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; while about ''LesFist Drug'' which has [[Chihiro Hasegawa]] [[fisting]] her mature lover Maki, TOHJIRO declared &quot;This is true lesbian sex!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=D1-211&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=&amp;next=1|title=Getting High On Lesbian Fist-fucking|accessdate=2008-09-22|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also one of the participants in a live SM-Night show with other [[Dogma studio]] actresses - a group known as director [[TOHJIRO]]'s M (Masochist) Women - for 200 Dogma fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/7m/sm_night/loft.html|title={{nihongo2|『SMナイト』}}[SM Naito]|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomoda starred in her first &quot;uncensored movie&quot; (where the genitals are not obscured by the mosaic pixelation used in all standard Japanese porn videos) in 2005, ''Zoom Vol. 10 Immoral Wife'',&lt;ref name=&quot;aventertainments&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aventertainments.com/product_lists.aspx?languageID=1&amp;Product_ID=10947|title=Zoom Vol. 10 Immoral Wife 猥褻不倫妻|accessdate=2009-01-14|publisher=[http://www.aventertainments.com/ AV Entertainments]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she appeared in two more in 2006: ''Erotic Apron - Maki Tomoda'' and ''Green Fantasy Special Adute Idol''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVFantasy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avfantasy.com/search_Products.aspx?section=0&amp;searchBy=starring&amp;keyword=Maki+Tomoda&amp;StudioID=0&amp;Dept_ID=0&amp;videotype=1|title=AV Fantasy - Maki Tomoda|accessdate=2008-09-20|publisher=[http://www.avfantasy.com/ www.avfantasy.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, at the second [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2nd D-1 Climax Awards 2006|D-1 Climax Awards]] ceremony, Tomoda was given the ''Erotic Cinderella'' (エロシンデレラ) award for Best Actress, along with [[Chihiro Hasegawa]] and [[Mayura Hoshitsuki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/d-1/openrepo/report3.html|title={{nihongo2|第3回}} D-1 CLIMAX Official Site|accessdate=2008-01-08|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ D-1 Climax Official Site]|language=Japanese|quote={{nihongo2|星月まゆら、長谷川ちひろ、友田真希の歴代エロシンデレラが選ぶ 【ベスト女優賞】瞳れん。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Tomoda appeared in a non-AV production, ''[[Kage no Hikari]]'', a documentary about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neoneoza.com/program/neofest_2007.html#kage_no_hikari|title={{nihongo2|『影の光』}}[Kage no hikari]|accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=[http://www.neoneoza.com/ www.neoneoza.com]|language=Japanese}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Her AV debut was in the May 2000 Cosmos Plan release, ''Venus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2000.htm|title=2000|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From her first video appearance, Watase's smile and legs gained particular attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Venus&quot;/&gt; Throughout her AV career Watase's long and slender legs continued to be singled out for praise in reviews of her videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horny-Bunny&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Be My Dutchwife&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT464|title=''Be My Dutchwife''|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Venus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=IT27|title=''Venus''|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Be My Dutchwife'' (August 2000), Watase played the role of a woman having a bad day in which she is sexually assaulted by both a stranger and her doctor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Be My Dutchwife&quot;/&gt;

In contrast to these previous videos which featured sex and lurid drama, ''Horny Bunny'', released in December 2000, simply focused on Watase's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horny-Bunny&quot;/&gt; ''No.1'' from January 2001 focused on the ''[[lotion play]]'' genre of Japanese pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=JF644|title=''No.1''|accessdate=2007-08-06|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of her adult film career Watase starred in over 100 releases. Later in her career, she appeared in the [[Moodyz]] video, ''[[Black Semen in L.A.]]'' (ブラックザーメン in L.A. - ''Burakku Zāmen in L.A.'', released on [[July 15]] [[2002]]), which was shot in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. In this video she engaged in [[group sex]] with five [[African-American]] men.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0781325|title=Black Semen in LA: Akira Watase}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watase was considered one of the most popular stars of the genre, until she retired from the industry in mid-2005.

In August 2008, Watase reappeared in the AV industry under the name of &quot;Rei Narumi&quot; (なるみ礼) with a release under that new name coming out in September on the DEEP's label for AV maker SOD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deeps.net/html/dvd_list/2008/h2009/des120/index.html|title=''Rei Narumi debut!''|accessdate=2008-08-29|publisher=[http://www.deeps.net DEEPs]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the content appears to be a re-edit of a 2005 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videomanial.co.jp/PG/?id=VRD10-COD009|title=''Young Female Anncouncer''|accessdate=2008-08-31|publisher=[http://www.videomanial.co.jp VideoManial]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Manami Yoshii'''|吉井愛美|Yoshii Manami|born [[November 11]], [[1981]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]}} is a well-known [[Japan]]ese [[pornographic movie|adult film]] actress. Described as &quot;a super lolita beauty,&quot; Yoshii was already popular as a [[gravure idol]] at the time of her AV debut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growing Up Journal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT480|title=''Growing Up Journal''|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Yoshii's first AV was the November 2000 release, ''Growing Up Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2000.htm|title=1995|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this first work in the AV industry, the popular gravure model is given one-on-one instruction from an experience AV actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growing Up Journal&quot;/&gt; ''Water Fruit'' (December 2000) was Yoshii's second adult video. Like her first release, it was made for the [[Kuki Inc.|KUKI]] studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=JF641|title=''Water Fruit''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also made for KUKI, Yoshii's third video, ''I Want to Get Lost'' (January 2001), had the actress at a ranch with a male actor, engaging in horse-back riding and fellatio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KT494|title=''I WANT TO GET LOST''|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked what was the most difficult thing she's had to do for an AV, Yoshii responded, &quot;I guess it was when I had to play a character that didn't fit me. It felt really awkward to say those lines.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Group Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Ex-S (translator)|last=Woo|year=2002|url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_57.html|title=Best Video: Group Interview|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=[http://www.jmate.com/ www.jmate.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Origin'' (March 2001), Yoshii filmed nude and sex scenes on location at a tropical beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin&quot;/&gt; ''Girls Just Can't Help it: Super High School Girls'' (April 2001) had Yoshii in the role of a young woman who is blackmailed into sex by her substitute teacher.

{{nihongo|'''Riria Yoshikawa'''|吉川 りりあ|Yoshikawa Riria}} (born [[July 11]], [[1970]], in [[Tokyo]]) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] actress, [[AV Idol]], and [[gravure idol]]. Known for her amorous voice, and angelic countenance, Yoshikawa made her AV debut in the November 1990 [[Alice Japan]] release, {{nihongo|''Can You Turn Around?''|ふりむいても紅色|Furimuite-kurenai}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1990_body.htm|title=1990|accessdate=2008-03-20|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshikawa was the star of director [[Sachi Hamano]]'s ''[[pink film]]'', {{nihongo2|いんらん美姉妹　義兄あさり}} released by Exces in April 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1991/do000750.htm|title=いんらん美姉妹　義兄あさり|accessdate=2009-07-29|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became one of the most popular AV idols in Japan during the early 1990s, and retired at the end of 1991 when she got married to Jun Fujioka (藤岡純), a male [[porn star]].

In 2002, she joined former AV actress [[Rui Sakuragi]] in a voice role for the [[anime]] erotic-horror film ''Youjuu Kyoushitsu Chapter 2'' (Demon Beast Invasion Chapter 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sazuma.com/item_9589_Youjuu-Kyoushitsu-Chapter-2.html|title=Youjuu Kyoushitsu Chapter 2|accessdate=2009-07-08|publisher=[http://www.sazuma.com/ www.sazuma.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a dozen years after her retirement, Alice Japan released a DVD, ''No Cut 4 Hours!! Riria Yoshikawa'', containing 4 of her earlier videos with the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;xcitye&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=DV353|title=Uncut 4 Hours!!

{{nihongo|'''Sally Yoshino'''|吉野サリー|Yoshino Sarii}} (born November 28, 1978) is a [[Japan]]ese [[striptease]] dancer, [[Model (person)|model]], and [[AV idol]] who has been called &quot;one of the true legends of [[Chronology of adult videos in Japan|AV]] (Adult Video).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_downloadjav&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downloadjav.com/actresses/actress.cfm?filename=sally_yoshino|title=Sally Yoshino|accessdate=2007-04-23|work=downloadjav.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Sally Yoshino was born {{nihongo|Sayuri Yoshinari|吉成小百合|Yoshinari Sayuri}} in [[Tokyo]] on [[November 28]], [[1978]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sally_Yoshino_IDic_Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?ysnsr_00|title=吉野サリー - Yoshino Sarii (Profile)|accessdate=2007-04-23|work=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic']}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her stage name of &quot;Sally Yoshino,&quot; she has also performed under the name {{nihongo|Kirara Tachibana|立花きらら|Tachibana Kirara}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sally_Yoshino_IDic_Profile&quot;/&gt; Her father was a member of a skate team, and Yoshino began figure skating at the age of three. In order to pursue this interest, she entered an athletic high school. There she also participated in gymnastics and ballet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_27.html|title=Sally Yoshino Interview|accessdate=2007-04-23|work=www.jmate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoshino began working in ''[[enjo kōsai]]'' (paid dating) while still a 17-year-old virgin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;/&gt; It was while engaged in this profession that she claims to have lost her virginity in Okubo Park in Tokyo's [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukichō]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Monty|last=DiPietro|title=Welcome to Misery Park|url=http://www.tokyohockey.com/miserypark.php|work=&quot;The Zeit Gist&quot; section of [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/ The Japan Times Online] (original source) archived in [http://www.tokyohockey.com/index.php Tokyo Street Hockey Association]|date=2007-01-30|accessdate=2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first customer was a talent company president in his 40s. He took her to the park in the middle of the afternoon for their sexual encounter. Recalling her feelings over the incident, Yoshino commented, &quot;I didn't care if I was a virgin or not. If I did, I couldn't do ''enjo kōsai''... I don't think I was taken advantage of. I got something out of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;/&gt;

While still 17 she was the victim of rape. She says, &quot;It was then that it didn't matter if I did this kind of work or not.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut===
Yoshino entered the entertainment field at the age of 18&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;/&gt; with her AV debut in the November 1997 release for the Cosmos Plan label, ''Younger Than Me''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=AP011|title=''Younger Than Me''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time she began appearing in magazine features, including one for ''[[Urecco]]'' in November 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sally_Yoshino_IDic_Profile&quot;/&gt; Her January, 1998 release, ''Cheeky Girl'', had the company still promoting Yoshino as &quot;Tokyo's New 18 Year-Old Girl.&quot; This was a documentary-style video, complete with [[hand-held camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=AP014|title=''Cheeky Girl''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Striptease===
Her background in athletics and dance was beneficial to her career in [[striptease]] dancing which began in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;/&gt; Though she has performed in many facets of the adult entertainment field, she considers stripping her favorite venue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_downloadjav&quot;/&gt; Though her AV career has been sporadic, her work as a striptease dancer has been continuous. When comparing her affinity for the striptease over AVs, Yoshino explains, &quot;I have been dancing for years. That is more fun... Everyone seems to hate stripping. Girls nowadays quit right away. I never thought of quitting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;/&gt;

Yoshino's stripping career occasionally resulted in trouble with the law. A special performance marking her birthday was widely advertised on the [[Internet]], and attracted some under-aged patrons. When the mother of a junior high school student who had attended the performance complained to the police, Yoshino was arrested for [[public indecency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yoshino_JMate_interview&quot;/&gt;

===AV come-back===
She made a come-back to the AV format with the January 2001 release, ''Sally Yoshino''. Her performance was praised as, &quot;much more mature and has an atmosphere of a sexy adult woman. Her sensual eyes and her panting voice are still the same.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1214|title=''Sally Yoshino''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshino's appearance in the ''Female Teacher Hunt'' series the following month continued her &quot;sensational comeback with a vengeance.&quot; Yoshino played the role of the teacher in a class of sex-starved males in this MAX-A release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2219|title=''Female Teacher Hunt in Sally Yoshino''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006 it was reported that Yoshino, now retired from AVs, was currently working as a striptease dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060305001357/mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|archivedate=2006-03-05|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|title=Porn starlets move on to inspiring second careers|accessdate=2007-04-23|last=Kamiyama|first=Masuo|date=[[2006-01-07]]|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of the same year, [[Kuki Inc.|KUKI]] issued a career retrospective disk of Yoshino's AV work for that studio entitled ''Playback, Sally Yoshino''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VDF020|title=''Playback, Sali Yoshino''|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 2006, [[Attackers]] released a previously unreleased video, date of filming unknown.

{{nihongo|'''Maiko Yūki'''|夕樹舞子|Yūki Maiko}} is a [[Japanese person|Japanese]] [[AV idol]], [[actress]], and [[stripper]]. One of the top AV idols in the mid-1990s, she was named the &quot;AV Girl of the Year&quot; in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800388263/info|title=Maiko Yuuki (1999)|accessdate=2008-01-03|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?userid=&amp;item_id=3234|title=Maiko Yuuki: Japan A.V. Girl Of The Year|accessdate=2008-01-04|publisher=[http://www.dvdempire.com/ www.dvdempire.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Yūki was the star performer in the first Japanese strip show to perform in the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;People's Republic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiansexgazette.com/asg/japan/japan02news30.htm|first=Masuo|last=Kamiyama|title=People's Republic gets to peek-in at Japanese strip tease|date=[[November 4]], [[2004]]|accessdate=2008-01-03|publisher=[http://www.asiansexgazette.com/ www.asiansexgazette.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Maiko Yūki was born {{nihongo|Maki Wakui|涌井 麻紀|Wakui Maki}} on [[January 30]], [[1977]] in [[Niigata Prefecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?yukmik00|date=2005-08-15|title=夕樹舞子 - Yuuki Maiko 
|accessdate=2008-01-03|publisher=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic' (Idol Dictionary)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family in the construction business.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/interviews/Maiko_Yuki/|date=2005-08-15|title=Maiko Yuki Interview|accessdate=2008-01-03|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/main/ www.jsexnetwork.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of her parents had been gang members, and Yūki was also a rowdy student who claims to have never lost a fight with a girl or boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt; Family difficulties led her to run away from home several times by the eighth grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt; Expelled on her first day in high school for fighting with the teacher, she returned home and began working as a golf caddy at a club.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt;

She had been determined to keep her virginity until marriage, however, at the age of 17 she was raped by her boyfriend's brother, the leader of a local gang. Shattered by the experience, she developed a fear of men.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut===
Yūki entered an acting school, where she met an AV actress manager. She made the decision to perform in an AV as a way of confronting and resolving her fears.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt; Her debut video was the April 1995 [[h.m.p. (Japan)|h.m.p.]] Tiffany release, ''Shojokyu Sotsugyo ~Graduation~''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1995.htm|title=1995|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first day on the set was difficult, and the shooting was delayed for five hours due to her emotional state. Yūki says that the AV staff were understanding, and this helped her to overcome her difficulties with her first video. She contrasts the AV staff's sympathetic attitudes with the more impersonal treatment she has had on television programs and for magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt; At first, her family was against her AV career, but they came to lend support for the signing event after her first AV release.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt;

For the next year, Yūki mostly alternated monthly videos for h.m.p. and another studio Cosmos Plan until her final work for h.m.p. ''Good-bye'' in May 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmp.jp/portal/catalog/goods/JH-NTF-009/|title=さよなら夕樹舞子.|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[http://www.hmp.jp/ www.hmp.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comeback===
She retired from the AV industry for a time, but, principally due to requests from her [[Hong Kong]] fans for new photobooks and videos, she came out of retirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt; In a come-back appearance in Hong Kong, she was surprised by the enthusiasm of the local press and her fan-base there. An autograph-signing drew a crowd of over 8,000, and she required six bodyguards while in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt;

Her experience in Hong Kong caused her see her work in AVs as a life's calling, and she decided to move to [[Tokyo]] to pursue this career full-time at age 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSex_Interview&quot;/&gt; She began her comeback in April 1998 with a series of videos for the [[Crystal-Eizou]] studio starting with ''Venus Return''. Her retirement work for Crystal-Eizou was the January 1999 video ''Final Maiko - Forever Angel'' but she later appeared in some S&amp;M productions for the Attackers and [[CineMagic Co.|CineMagic]] studios. 

In 2004 Yūki was the star performer in the first Japanese strip show to perform in the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;People's Republic&quot;/&gt;

An &quot;uncensored&quot; video (one without the mosaic pixelation to obscure the genitals required in videos sold legally in Japan) with Yūki was released by Samurai Porn in July 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;samurai&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avfantasy.com/product_lists.aspx?product_id=28265&amp;videotype=1|title=SAMURAIPORN VOL.3 : Maiko Yuuki|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=[http://www.avfantasy.com/ AV Fantasy]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV debut and Max-A===
Yuzuki's AV debut was in the November 2005 release for MAX-A's Calen label, ''Hot Wind'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2005.htm|title=2005|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed before her 19th birthday, her peppy personality and blushing skin tones were used as selling points for this documentary-style AV release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1415|title=''Hot Wind / Tina Yuzuki''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of Yuzuki's premier video uses the name 'Toshio,' and has continued to work with the actress throughout her AV career. Yuzuki and director Toshio's most recent collaboration was in the March 2007 release, ''High School Uniform and Machine-Gun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XC1415|title=''High School Uniform and Machine-Gun''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yuzuki's second video, ''Feel Refreshing'' (December, 2005) left the popular documentary style for a narrative fiction story in which she played a sexually-curious high school student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV316|title=''Feel Refreshing / Tina Yuzuki''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her third video had her playing the role of an office lady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV329|title=''Dramatic Love''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''IMPRESSIVE / Make My Dream'' from March 2006, Yuzuki worked in the popular ''[[cosplay]]'' genre. The costumes worn by Yuzuki in the video included that of a nurse, a maid, and a &quot;Gothic Lolita.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV329|title=''IMPRESSIVE / Tina Yuzuki: make my dream''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She donned the nurse and waitress costumes again in her entry in Max-A's popular ''Welcome to Max Cafe!'' series, released in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV365|title=''Welcome to Max Cafe! / Tina Yuzuki''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, Max-A chose Yuzuki to star in their May 2006 release, ''My Wife Is Tina!'', the first video in the company's newlywed housewife series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV378|title=''My wife is Tina!''|accessdate=2007-06-04|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Confined Body Doll X - ascription'', released in June, had Yuzuki in a &quot;psycho thriller&quot; mystery involving missing girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV390|title=''Confined Body Doll X - ascription''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would again star in a suspense-drama in the January 2007 release ''High School Girl Abducted'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV484|title=''High School Girl Abducted, Tina Yuzuki''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a crime-drama in the March 2007 release, ''High School Uniform and Machine-Gun''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV484|title=''High School Uniform and Machine-Gun''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, Yuzuki made her first foray into the incest genre with ''Sister's Secret''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV401|title=''Sister's Secret / Tina Yuzuki''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Passion: Tina's Mystery Tour'' is an adventure involving a treasure hunt for a gigantic [[vibrator]], a guide who demands [[fellatio]], and tribe of sex-hungry natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV421|title=''Passion: Tina's Mystery Tour''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2006, Max-A again picked Yuzuki to star in the first entry in a new series. Entitled ''Urekko'', the video was released in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV460|title=''Urekko''|accessdate=2007-06-09|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Yuzuki's appearances was in the July 2007 release, ''Tina and Her Friends'', where she plays a space girl who flies down to Earth and after some harrowing experiences finds love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XV556|title=''Tina and Her Friends''|accessdate=2007-07-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rio and S1===
Beginning with her October 12, 2007 release, ''Endless Ecstasy Fuck'', for Max-A, Yuzuki adopted the stage name of Rio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=xv585|title=''Non-Stop Extreme Fucking''|accessdate=2008-11-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the name she has used in all original videos since. After spending two years making videos exclusively for Max-A, Yuzuki left that company early in 2008 to join [[S1 No. 1 Style]], part of Japan's largest porn company, the [[Hokuto Corporation]]. She released her first video with them, ''Risky Mosaic Rio'', directed by [[Hideto Aki]], in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.s1s1s1.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=16380/|title=Rio - S1 Profile &amp; Filmography|accessdate=2008-11-18|publisher=[http://www.s1s1s1.com/ www.s1s1s1.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued working for S1, producing one video per month, through the beginning of 2009 when she once again began performing for Max-A.

In another entertainment area, Suzuki along with other S1 actresses [[Sora Aoi]], [[Yuma Asami]] and [[Mihiro]] was a regular on the late night TV variety show {{nihongo|''Please Muscat''|おねがい マスカット|Onegai Muscat}} which began airing on [[TV Osaka]] in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/jav-stars-maria-ozawa-and-sora-host-osaka-tv-variety-show/|title=JAV stars Maria Ozawa and Sora Aoi host Osaka TV Variety show|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ Japan Sugoi]|accessdate=2009-06-16|date=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio appeared in her first mainstream movie in 2009, the schoolgirl prostitute revenge erotic thriller ''Stop the Bitch Campaign'' (Enjo-kosai bokumetsu undo or 援助交際撲滅運動) directed by Kosuke Suzuki with [[Kenichi Endo]] as the evil villain. The film, the third in the series, debuted at the [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]] in February 2009 followed by a series of screenings in March at the Cinema Rosa in the [[Ikebukuro]] district of Tokyo. A DVD was released in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1363366/|title=Enjo-kôsai bokumetsu undô (2009)|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMdB]|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spopro.net/stbc/|title=Stop the Bitch Campaign Official Site|publisher=[http://www.spopro.net/ www.spopro.net]|accessdate=2009-05-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, she was one of three AV Idols appearing in the joint Japanese-Korean production ''Korean Classroom'' which was broadcast on Korean TV in May 2009. Along with her fellow stars [[Sora Aoi]] and [[Mihiro]], she traveled to Korea to promote the four part series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/index.php/full_story/aoi_sora_and_mihiro_promote_korean_classroom/|title=Aoi Sora and Mihiro promote Korean Classroom|publisher=[http://www.allkpop.com/ AllKPop]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yuri Komuro'''|小室友里|Komuro Yuri}} (born [[July 28]], [[1976]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]) is a [[Japan]]ese [[AV idol]], actress, and author. She was one of the top actresses in the AV field during the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Masuo|last=Kamiyama|title=Porn starlets move on to inspiring second careers|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060305001357/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2006/01/20060107p2g00m0dm017000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[January 7]], [[2006]]|archivedate=2006-03-05|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life and AV career===
Yuri Komuro was born in Japan's [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] on [[July 28]], [[1976]], 
Komuro comments, &quot;I've always had a strong sexual awareness, even as a kid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt; While still in [[kindergarten]] she asked a neighborhood boy to play with her breasts. Komuro recalls once, still at an early age, inviting a university student to give her a [[blow job]] before she knew what the term meant. She comments that the resultant experience with [[cunnilingus]] would today be considered a sex crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt;

Komuro began studying for a career as a travel agent before she began work in the adult entertainment field.&lt;ref name=&quot;losing gleam&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Japanese porn star, 20, losing gleam after 10 films|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&amp;s_site=dfw&amp;p_multi=ST&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF914747630F09&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|publisher=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|page=p.14|date=[[October 26]], [[1997]]|accessdate=2008-01-19|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her decision to work in the AV industry was based on a desire to do something more unusual. &quot;I thought if I did this,&quot; she comments, &quot;I could change my life, Otherwise, I figured my future would be pretty predictable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;losing gleam&quot;/&gt;

Komuro made her AV debut with [[h.m.p. (Japan)|h.m.p.]] on their Tiffany label in January 1996, the same month as fellow AV Idol, [[Miki Sawaguchi]]. Komuro continued working for h.m.p. for her first two years in the AV industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1996.htm|title=1996|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]|quote=小室友里／新・官能姫 第2章 （ティファニー）}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later AVs===
In January 1998 Komuro made her debut with [[Alice Japan]]. In the video, ''Sexy Butt'', Komuro portrays an extraterrestrial who inspires interest in inter-galactic sexual activity from earthlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA1865|title=Sexy Butt|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alice Japan's ''Saint Prostitute'' had Komuro as a woman who plans to molest men on a train, but becomes a victim herself instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9076|title=Saint Prostitute|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same company's ''Inhumanity'' had Komuro attempting to shed her humanity through continual sexual activity. She performs fellatio on ten actors, has sex with ten actors, and concludes the video by sharing childhood memories with the AV audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV006|title=Inhumanity|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Anal Fuck'', Komuro takes up a challenge to concentrate solely on activities dealing with her rear end. Examination, shaving, vibrators and enemas ensue until the video concludes with the actress fainting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kr9094|title=Anal Fuck|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept behind Alice Japan's ''Queen Slut'' was to have Komuro seducing hapless men. The project goes awry, however, when Komuro herself becomes the victim of a &quot;powerful group of molesters&quot; before she can act her part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DC065|title=Queen Slut|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, Atlas21 director Kei Morikawa made Komuro's career the subject of the documentary ''Legend Of An AV Idol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=8A055|title=Legend of an AV Idol|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morikawa again directed Komuro in the September 1998 ''[[cosplay]]''-themed video ''NEO Bloody Uniform Connection 44''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=8A093|title=NEO Bloody Uniform Connection 44|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlas21's November 1998 release, ''The Serial Fuck'' had Komuro as a bicyclist attacked by a gang of rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=8A112|title=The Serial Fuck|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of her AV career, Komuro took advantage of her popularity to engage in a business venture. She lent her name to the advertising of a perfume which, it was claimed, was based on the smell of a pair of panties she had worn for several days without changing. The perfume was called &quot;Asoko,&quot; literally meaning, &quot;That place,&quot; a Japanese euphemism for the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Porno world spreads its legs and shoots out a few secrets|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/09/20030914p2g00m0dm999000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060322081536/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2003/09/20030914p2g00m0dm999000c.html|archivedate=2006-03-22|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[September 14]], [[2003]]|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of her high earning, however, after retiring from the AV field, Komuro realized that she had not been very wise with her money. &quot;I blew my money in all kinds of spectacular ways, What was left, I used to buy a car and personal computer. If I had saved the income from just three films, things wouldn't be so tight now. Life is hard for AV actresses once they retire.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt;

===Post-AV career===
By the time Komuro announced her retirement plans from the AV industry in 1999 with ''Last Scene'', it was claimed, with perhaps some hyperbole, that she had spilled the sperm of some 20 million Japanese men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/japan/info.html?id=ka1942|title=LastScene|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English|quote=日本全国の成人男子２千万人（推定）のスペルマを絞り採ったＡＶクィーン・小室友里...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Komuro later commented of this part of her life, &quot;When I look back at my acting days, it was lots of fun. Just by following somebody's instructions to disrobe I could make millions, or even tens of millions of yen. I think back on the opportunity with a sense of gratitude.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt;

Komuro's AV industry past was reflected in her role in director Masato Ishioka's debut feature film, {{nihongo|''Scoutman''|ペイン|Pain}}. In this gritty depiction of Japan's AV industry, Komuro played the role of Miki, a former ''tantai'' (star-quality) AV actress whose adult video career is kept a secret from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/scoutman.shtml|title=Scoutman|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com/ midnighteye.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kei Morikawa, Komuro's AV director from her Atlas days, has a role as an AV director.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0266945|Scoutman (2000)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was presented at several international film festivals, including the [[Venice Film Festival]] and the [[Toronto Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David|last=Strattona|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788700.html|title=Scout-Man|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematopics.com/cinema/works/output2.php?oid=857|title=PAIN／ペイン Scoutman|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://www.cinematopics.com/ Cinema Topics Online]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for Best Asian Feature Film at the [[Singapore International Film Festival]], and won Ishioka the Directors' Week Special Jury Award at the Fantasporto competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266945/awards|title=Awards for Scoutman (2000)|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[[IMDB]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Komuro starred in pioneering porn actress and director [[Kyoko Aizome]]'s April [[2002 in film|2002]] film, ''Kyoko Aizome's Molester's Hospital''. Komuro played the role of a lawyer trying to solve a case of serial rapes at a hospital run by Aizome. [[Alice Japan]] released the film in October in AV format with the title ''Molester In a Hospital''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9172|title=Molester In A Hospital|accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though she concedes, &quot;Most of what I do has some sort of connection with eroticism,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt; writing had always been one of Komuro's interests. During her AV career she had written a series of essays expressing her thoughts on topics such as friends, family, work, love, the AV industry, and sex. In December of 1998 a collection of these essays were published under the title {{nihongo|''Bare Faced''|素顔}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcatplus-equal.nii.ac.jp/libportal/DocDetail?txt_docid=jBKID%3AB9849673|title=素顔 |accessdate=2008-01-18|publisher=[[Webcat Plus]]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fellow AV idol Runa Hoshizaki gave Komuro an introduction, she began pursuing writing as a career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt; Komuro wrote sex-advice articles, conducted interviews with sex industry workers, and wrote pieces which were serialized in journals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt; 

In 2006, it was reported that Komuro had moved on to a second career in journalism, covering the field of erotic entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Antonio R. |last= Samson|title=Fence Sitter|url= |work= BusinessWorld|location= Manila|publisher= |date= 2006-01-17|accessdate=18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of her life-long involvement with erotic entertainment, looking back on her AV career, Komuro says, &quot;I never had an orgasm during a film shooting. Except when somebody worked on me with a vibrator.&quot; In 2006, seven years after retirement from the AV industry, Komuro stated, &quot;I'm finally at the stage where I can really enjoy sex.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porn starlets move on&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Miho Maeshima'''|前嶋美歩|Maeshima Miho}}, also known as '''Miho Maejima''', is a popular [[Japan]]ese [[Model (person)|model]] and [[AV idol]] who formerly appeared on broadcast television in Japan. 

==Life and career==
Miho Maeshima was born in [[Tokyo]] on [[July 26]], [[1986]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt; She reports that her first experience with sex was with her boyfriend in his closet. His mother had come into his room with a vacuum cleaner while they were beginning the act, and they hid in the closet where they finished. She says that she has not had sex with a lot of men, since she remained with this boyfriend for another four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut===
Maeshima made her [[adult video]] (AV) debut just before her twentieth birthday in June 2006 with ''Tender Petting (Caressing Pururun)'' for the [[h.m.p. (Japan)|h.m.p.]] Hoyusha label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmp.jp/portal/catalog/goods/HYSD-00021/|title=愛撫でるぷるるんっ
|publisher=[http://www.hmp.jp/ www.hmp.jp]|accessdate=2009-06-04|language=Japanese}} &quot;超新星デビューです！&quot; (A supernova debut!)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006 she appeared in ''The Naked'', an &quot;image&quot; video, consisting of nude modeling without sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SFLB051|title=''The Naked / Miho Maeshima''|accessdate=2007-07-16|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent videos for h.m.p. have her performing for a hidden webcam in her room (''Peeping x Shamefulness Eroticism''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=hyrd00030|title=Peeping &amp; Humiliating, &quot;I'm feeling dirty eyes&quot;|accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; having a birthday celebration in the Japanese porn &quot;lotion&quot; genre with her birthday cake spread on her body (''Perversion Smear Nice Sensation Lotion'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=hyrd00033|title=Perverter With Sticky Lotion|accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performing in the documentary-style ''Saliva Coating Fellatio'' supposedly focused on her private sex life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=hyrd00040|title=Fellatio Covered With Spit|accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Her April 2007 release, ''Illegal Invasion of Tits'', was Maeshima's first solo work for the MAX-A label. This video had Maeshima in the role of a woman who breaks into a wealthy man's home intending to rob him. The owner catches her and subjects her to various forms of humiliations employing swearing, lotion, and a vibrator. When the rich man's servant arrives on the scene, Maeshima is forced to perform fellatio on the two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XV527|title=''Illegal Invasion of Tits, Miho Maejima''|accessdate=2007-07-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Crazy Angel'', from May 2007, Maeshima plays an angel who is sent to earth to find the Stone of Life, which she has dropped. This scenario allows Maeshima to work in the popular ''[[cosplay]]'' genre of AVs by donning various costumes, including that of a waitress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SRXV538|title=''Crazy Angel, Miho Maejima''|accessdate=2007-07-18|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, Maeshima also began performing in videos for the Premium studio's Glamorous label (''Deep Impacts - Miho Maeshima Sell Debut'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premium-beauty.com/works/-/list/=/article=actress/id=18608/|title=Miho Maeshima Profile &amp; Filmography|accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=[http://www.premium-beauty.com/ www.premium-beauty.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maeshima appeared in an &quot;uncensored&quot; video ''Kamikaze Girls Vol. 55'' in July 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;kamikaze&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xonair.com/detail.cfm?id=10090113&amp;pid=asian&amp;lang=US|title=Kamikaze Girls Vol. 55 (Miho Maejima) (kg055)|publisher=[http://www.xonair.com/ X On Air]|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncensored videos lack the mosaic pixelation to obscure the genitals that is necessary for sales in Japan. AV actresses sometimes release an uncensored video at the end of their career and Maeshima does not seem to have made any original videos since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/list/=/page=2/article=actress/id=18608/|title=DVD通販 &gt; AV女優 &gt; 前嶋美歩(まえしまみほ)|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ DMM]|accessdate=2009-06-05|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Ayane Miura'''|三浦綺音|Miura Ayane|extra=born [[May 8]] [[1974]]}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[model (person)|model]], singer and stage and screen [[actress]]. As an actress she portrayed Sadako Yamamura in the 1995 Japanese TV movie ''[[Ring (film)|Ring: Kanzenban]]''.

Miura has appeared in several [[V-Cinema]] films. In 1996 she appeared in an entry in the popular ''Rapeman'' series. Telling the saga of Rapeman Services, a company of professional rapists whose motto is &quot;Righting wrongs through penetration&quot;, the original film inspired six sequels and two spin-off films. In their ''Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films'', the Weissers write that the series director, Takao Nagaishi, took &quot;a patently offensive premise and twisted it into a wickedly funny black-comedy for adults... His camerawork is slick, and the music is hypnotic. Plus he has co-authored clever scripts with surprisingly intricate plotlines. And, most importantly, Nagaishi has taken the time to develop a group of characters who are actually very likable.&quot; Miura's episode, ''The Rape-Man of Edo'' takes the concept of the series into samurai milieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|pages=341-342|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-889288-52-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Kyōko Aizome was born Kyōko Yamazaki on February 9, 1958 in Noda, Chiba Prefecture. Aizome grew up in a troubled household. Her father was a police officer who beat his wife, and her parents divorced about 1974, when Aizome was 16 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koizumi&quot;/&gt; Soon after graduation from high school, Aizome was scouted in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku]] neighborhood by a photographer for nude magazines. She saw nude modeling as a stepping-stone into a career in entertainment. First taking the stage name Kyōko Aoyama, she was soon appearing in films such as director [[Shinya Yamamoto]]'s ''Molester's Subway''&lt;ref name=&quot;Shin-Toho&quot;/&gt; and &quot;violent pink&quot; director [[Yasuharu Hasebe]]'s [[1978 in film|1978]] [[Nikkatsu]] ''[[Roman Porno]]'', ''Raping!'' (''Yaru!'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citwf.com/film5931.htm|title=''YARU! / RAPING!''|accessdate=2007-03-04|publisher=[http://www.citwf.com/ Complete Index to World Film]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a leading role in one of director [[Noboru Tanaka]]'s major ''Roman Porno'' films, ''Pink Salon: Five Lewd Women'' (1978), based on the erotic novel, ''Five Licentious Women'' aka ''Five Women Who Loved Love'' by [[Ihara Saikaku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|date= |year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-88928-852-7|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in the seventh episode of Nikkatsu's [[Koichiro Uno]] series, director [[Akira Kato]]'s ''Koichiro Uno's Moist And Steamy'' ([[1979 in film|1979]])&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.449.&lt;/ref&gt;, and the following year she worked under director Noboru Tanaka again for his ''Nami'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), the third entry in Nikkatsu's ground-breaking ''[[Angel Guts]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;''Angel Guts – The Nikkatsu Series – 5 Disc Collector's Edition – High School Co-ed; Red classroom; Nami; Red Porno; Red Vertigo''. 2005. www.artsmagicdvd.com ATU 017. Disc three: Nami; Biographies: Kyōko Aoyama.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Daydream''===
Pioneer ''[[pinku eiga]]'' director [[Tetsuji Takechi]] noticed Aizome in one of her nude photo magazine appearances. ''Pinku eiga'', or &quot;pink films&quot;, are the softcore genre of sex-film which dominated Japan's domestic cinema during the 1960s and 1970s. Tetsuji had made ''[[Daydream (1964 film)|Daydream]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), the first big-budget ''pink film''. He chose Aizome to star in his hardcore remake of this film, also called ''[[Daydream (1981 film)|Daydream]]'' ([[1981 in film|1981]]), giving the actress her leading-role debut. Japan's first theatrically released film featuring hardcore sex, Aizome added to the controversy surrounding the film by admitting to having performed actual sexual intercourse on camera. Though, as Japanese law required, sexual organs and pubic hair were fogged on screen, the [[Asahi Shimbun]] calls it Japan's first hardcore [[pornographic]] movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koizumi&quot;/&gt; By 1981, hardcore [[Chronology of adult videos in Japan|AVs]] (adult videos) were already starting to win over the adult entertainment audience in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; but the film became a hit with theatrical audiences. Uncensored copies of the film were also circulated illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Aizome gained national notoriety from her status as Japan's first porn-movie superstar, comparable to the U.S.'s [[Linda Lovelace]] and [[Marilyn Chambers]]. She made her debut in the still-young AV industry in November 1981, making her one of Japan's earliest [[AV idols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1981.htm|title=1981|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name became a marketing tool and was used in the titles of such later theatrical releases as ''Kyōko Aizome's Somber Reminiscence'' (''Aizome Kyōko Kareinaru Tsuioku'') ([[1983 in film|1983]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:249618|last=Firsching|first=Robert|title=''Aizome Kyōko Kareinaru Tsuioku''|accessdate=2007-04-19|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|quote=This softcore pinku eiga film from Joy Pack Film and director Tadashi Yoyogi was made to capitalize on the notoriety of starlet Kyōko Aizome. She had attracted some notice by breaking the Japanese film taboo of displaying pubic hair in Tetsuji Takechi's 1981 remake of his 1964 classic Hakujitsumu.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shinya Yamamoto]]'s ''Kyōko Aizome's Widow's Boarding House'' (''Aizome Kyōko no Mibōjin Geshuku'') ([[1984 in film|1984]]).&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.230&lt;/ref&gt;

Aizome's fame resulting from ''Daydream'' also led her to embark on a successful live-performance career in [[striptease]] which lasted until her retirement in July 1994. While engaged in stripping, she was arrested twice in 1983 for indecent exposure. She used her jail time to review her career and re-dedicate herself to a life in adult entertainment. She also resolved to build a two-story, six-bedroom house in Chiba Prefecture, which she gave to her mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koizumi&quot;/&gt;

Takechi Tetsuji filmed ''Daydream'' for the third time in 1987, as ''Daydream 2'' (''Hakujitsumu Zoku''), and again hired Aizome for the lead role. According to the Weissers, each filming of ''Daydream'' had become progressively more exploitive, with the last, imported to the United States under the title ''Captured For Sex'' having the lowest production values and focusing most on sex and a torture orgy.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.102-103&lt;/ref&gt;

===After ''Daydream''===
Since ''Daydream'', Aizome has been active in acting and directing in Japan's prolific [[adult video]] and ''[[softcore]]'' porn-movies. About 1986, in one of her more remarkable performances, Aizome had her hymen surgically restored so that it could be broken during the film. Previously a common procedure, hymen restorations went out of favor in Japan about the time of Aizome's use of it. The doctor who performed the restoration reports that the last time he did this surgery was on a couple in their 50s who, after seeing Aizome's film, wished to undergo the operation for their second honeymoon. In an article on the procedure, Aizome told ''Shukan Bunshun'', &quot;They strung a thread almost like a piano wire through the entrance to my vagina and pulled it like a drawstring to recreate the hymen. They give your privates a local anesthetic, so the operation itself doesn't really hurt. I really felt like a virgin again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryann|last=Connell|title=Surgeon says demise of hymen restoration operations no skin off his, er... nose?|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2006/12/20061204p2g00m0dm003000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|publisher= |date=2006-12-04|accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aizome gained an international audience in the 1986 [[Traci Lords]] film, ''[[Traci Takes Tokyo]]''. With her name mis-credited as &quot;Kyōko Izoma&quot;, the porn-video was shot in Tokyo before Lords' scandal, and is therefore now illegal in the U.S. Her lesbian scene with Lords was reused in ''[[Beverly Hills Copulator]]''.

She retired from regular performances in pornography in 1994, but continued to act in erotic films occasionally. She continued working behind the camera in the industry in various capacities including writing and directing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hell hath no fury&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Hell hath no fury like a porn star scorned -- just ask her niece|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20070512p2a00m0na014000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=2007-05-12|accessdate=2007-05-14|quote=After retiring from the porn world in 1994, Teranishi became a sex counselor and a porn film director.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Film credits at: {{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0025220.htm|title=愛染恭子 (Aizome Kyouko)|accessdate=2007-05-14|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Aizome was writing a sex- and health-advice column for women in Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;Koizumi&quot;/&gt; titled &quot;Auntie Agony&quot;.

She teamed up with &quot;[[AV idol|AV Queen]]&quot; [[Hitomi Kobayashi]] in the February 2001 theatrical release, ''Kyōko Aizome vs. Hitomi Kobayashi: Sexual Excitement Competition'' (愛染恭子ＶＳ小林ひとみ　発情くらべ). Aizome both starred in and directed the film, which was released by Nikkatsu's post-''Roman porn'' distributor of theatrical pornography, Excess films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2001/dy000370.htm|title=愛染恭子ＶＳ小林ひとみ　発情くらべ|accessdate=2007-05-31|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=249637|title=Bed Partner 1988 (review)|accessdate=2007-05-31|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|quote=...the legendary studio proper [Nikkatsu] (its stepchild, Excess Films, limped along for years thereafter...}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adult video starring the two actresses and also directed by Aizome followed in March. Entitled ''Lesbian Wives'', the video had Aizome and Kobayashi playing the wives of two ''[[yakuza]]'' bosses who become engaged in a lesbian relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9144|title=''Lesbian Wives''|accessdate=2007-05-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, she directed the AV ''Lesbian Politicians'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), in which she also co-starred with the popular award-winning AV actress [[Ai Kurosawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KR9191|title=''Lesbian Politicians''|accessdate=2007-06-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, she starred in the [[Madonna (studio)|Madonna]] hardcore AV ''Widow's Obscene Desire'' (愛欲の未亡人) which won her a Madonna Best Actress Award at the 2005 [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#Moodyz Awards (2001-2008)|Moodyz Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20060119A/index2.htm| title=ムーディーズ＆ドグマ年末イベントレポート|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ All About]|date=January 19, 2006|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also appeared in a further video for Madonna, ''Mother and Son Incest'' (近親相姦 母と息子) with Yume Imano in May 2006 when Aizome was 48 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madonna-av.com/works/-/detail/=/cid=juk400/|title=近親相姦 母と息子|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=[http://www.madonna-av.com/ www.madonna-av.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several years out of the public eye, Aizome's name was in the news again in 2007 when she was arrested for beating her niece. Aizome admitted to the allegations and was fined 500,000 yen. She explained, &quot;I hit my niece to punish her for dating my boyfriend. But it went too far.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hell hath no fury&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Azumi Kawashima'''|川島和津実|Kawashima Azumi}}, born August 8, 1979 in Tokyo, Japan, is a [[Japanese idol]] and Adult Video actress (or so-called &quot;[[AV idol]]&quot;).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Complete Azumi Kawashima&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=OSD108|title=Complete Azumi Kawashima|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kawashima was already known as a &quot;gravure princess&quot; at the time of her AV debut in December of 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;PROMISE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA081|title=PROMISE|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May, 1999 she was called one of the most popular AV idols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA105|title=Pretty Wife 7|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;the number one AV idol&quot; by August of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azu-mi-x&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA121|title=Azu-mi-x|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Azu-mi-x II&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA185|title=Azu-mi-x II|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Azumi Kawashima was born in Tokyo on August 8, 1979, and enjoys swimming and walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=589|title=Azumi (Kawashima Azumi)|accessdate=2007-06-13|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a favorite among fans of the Japanese AV principally because her &quot;classical elegant beauty&quot;, as her appearances are not as extreme or hardcore as many other such videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;actionjav&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/model.cfm?actress_filename=azumi_kawashima|title=Azumi Kawashima|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kawashima's debut video was ''Promise'' released under Sexia's Try Heart label in December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1998.htm|title=1998|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PROMISE&quot;/&gt; In January 1999, Kawashima starred in ''Naive'', for the Shy label. Her next video for Sexia, ''I Want To Hold You'' (February 1999), was a sex-oriented drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA092|title=I Want To Hold You|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was back at Shy for the April 1999 release, ''Natural''. This video was judged a well-acted drama with great sex scenes, involving gangsters and an assassination plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=1116|title=Natural|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawashima followed popular AV idol [[Haruki Mizuno]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA050|title=''Pretty Wife 4''|accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sexia's ''Pretty Wife'' series. Kawashima's entry, the seventh in the series, was subtitled ''Dangerous Love Triangle'' and released in May 1999. She played the role of a woman who is the victim of her wicked mother-in-law. Hoping to save her son from what she believes to be his wife's demoralizing influence, the mother hires two men to rape her. She hopes that if her son witnesses his wife having sex with other men, he will then divorce her. Instead, the entire group join up to scold the mother for being too controlling. The video ends with the mother awakening, discovering it's all been a dream, and taking it as a message to leave her son's house. ActionJAV judges this video &quot;Another great action packed movie performed by the legendary Azumi Kawa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/title.cfm?iid=2058|title=Pretty Wife 7|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA105|title=Pretty Wife 7|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a year after her debut, Kawashima's popularity prompted Sexia to release a retrospective video, ''Azu-mi-x'', which included scenes from her first video as well as new material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azu-mi-x&quot;/&gt; Sexia's February 2000 multi-star video, ''ALL STARS: Erotic Lips Selection'', had Kawashima on the same tape as fellow ''Pretty Wife'' veteran, Haruki Mizuno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA153|title=ALL STARS|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second retrospective video, ''Azu-mi-x II: Wazumi's Filmography'', was released in September 2000 in a &quot;permanent collector's edition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azu-mi-x II&quot;/&gt; Kawashima's last releases, a video entitled ''Memory'', and a DVD named ''Complete Azumi Kawashima'', came out in July 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Complete Azumi Kawashima&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=SEA332|title=Memory: Azumi Kawashima|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her video career, Kawashima's portfolio includes the release of 9 photobooks released from 1999 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jans-web.com/profiles/n0438&amp;mode=books2|title=Azumi Kawashima 川島和津実 Books |accessdate=20090-06-20|publisher=[http://jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of her adult work, Kawashima also had a major part in the 1999 [[V-Cinema]] horror film ''Demon Killer'' or ''Junreiki'' 殉霊鬼（じゅんれいき) directed by Seki Akitsugu where six men and women staying at a villa are attacked by a killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=234168|title=殉霊鬼（じゅんれいき）(1999)|publisher=[http://www.allcinema.net/ AllCinema]|accessdate=20090-06-20|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fjmovie.com/horror/j/t6/64.html|title=殉霊鬼 (VIDEO)|publisher=[http://www.fjmovie.com/ Japanese Horror Movie Database]|accessdate=20090-06-20|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{nihongo|'''Nozomi Kurahashi'''|倉橋のぞみ|extra=born 1975}} is an alias chosen by {{nihongo|'''Yoshizawa Ayumi'''|吉沢 あゆみ}} following her debut as a nude [[gravure idol]].
She published nude photo collections every year mainly during her time when she was known to be a middle school student.

Since the compilation of [[Lolita]] [[photobook]]s in the 1980s was not yet illegal in [[Japan]], readers were able to see Nozomi's body in explicit detail and she soon gained immense popularity as an ideal Lolita model. 

Furthermore, Nozomi Kurahashi was two years younger than declared at the time of the publication of her 1980's photobooks, her actual age being 11 instead of 13 in 1986.
At age 13, she had her last photobook published before her disappearance from the idol world which lasted until the turn of the century when, at age 24, she announced another nude photobook. 

Her book ''Nozomi Kurahashi, age 24'' contains many retaken photographs from her younger years.

{{nihongo|'''Hikaru Koto''' / '''Hikaru Coto'''|古都 ひかる|Koto Hikaru}} is a former [[Japanese person|Japanese]] [[AV idol]] and model.

==Life and career==
Koto made her [[adult video]] (AV) debut at age eighteen in the September 2003 release, {{nihongo|''Virgin Princess - natural''|処女宮 -natural-}} on the [[h.m.p. (Japan)|h.m.p.]]/Platinum Tiffany label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2003.htm|title=2003|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2009, [http://www.amazon.co.jp/s?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=%8C%C3%93s+%82%D0%82%A9%82%E9 Amazon.co.jp] listed 67 DVDs of her performances, as well as 6 books and 9 videos.

Because of her youth, Koto was often presented in [[cosplay]] roles as a high-school girl. This can be seen in the May 2004 release ''Ero Comic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=hrdv00088|title=Ero Comic|accessdate=2008-11-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her June 2004 video, ''Indecent Attraction'', the plot has her being hypnotized to become a nymphomaniac (the box title proclaims &quot;She became a beast&quot;). One of her male companions is famous AV actor [[Chocoball Mukai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=hrdv00096|title=Lecherous Rouge|accessdate=2008-11-10|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005 Koto was given the Best Actress Grand Prize at the 2005 [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] for her work on the Rainbow Channel in the 2004 broadcasting season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/nlbn/NL000500/vl_16.htm|title=2004年度ＣＳアダルト番組アワード開催 (CS 2004 year Adult Awards Show)|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ AllAbout]|date=February 28, 2005|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|accessdate=2008-10-27|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her entire AV career working for [[h.m.p. (Japan)|h.m.p.]] and released her last original video with them in July 2004. A 4 volume DVD compilation of her complete works was released by h.m.p. in July and August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmp.jp/portal/actress/detail/J065/?b=001|title=古都ひかる Hikaru Koto セルDVD|accessdate=2008-11-09|publisher=[http://www.hmp.jp/ www.hmp.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hikaru Koto, since retiring from the adult industry, has become a [[YouTube]] personality known as 'Cotorich' and is famous for her frequent use of &quot;Ohayō. Konnichiwa. Konbanwa&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/user/cotorich?blend=1&amp;ob=4&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Keiko Nakazawa'''|中沢慶子|Nakazawa Keiko}}, born September 9, 1965, is an award-winning [[Japan]]ese [[AV idol]] and ''[[pink film]]'' actress who gained popularity among AV viewers during the mid-1980s.

== Life and career ==
Nakazawa made her AV debut for the Cosmos Plan label in December 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;kurokami&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1985.htm|title=1985|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she retired in 1989, she had appeared in dozens of Japanese AVs several of them for [[Alice Japan]], including inaugurating their long-running &quot;Bocky&quot; series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alicejapan.co.jp/actress.php?actress_id=60011a0799fa2c715877ad89316f0e3c|title=中沢慶子|accessdate=2009-07-22|publisher=[http://www.alicejapan.co.jp/ www.alicejapan.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was popular for her tanned skin and slender, athletic body.&lt;ref name=&quot;shintoho&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/K_NAKAZAWA/index.html|title=Keiko Nakazawa|accessdate=2007-07-21|language=English|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/SHIN-TOHO/HISTORY/ Shin-Toho History xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having worked as a waitress at a [[Tokyo]] restaurant prior to her debut in adult videos, she was nicknamed the &quot;Downtown Sun&quot; by many Japanese [[salaryman|salarymen]].

In [[1986 in film|1986]] she made her theatrical film debut in the [[Nikkatsu]] [[Roman Porno]] ''Romanko Club - Lots of Sex''. She followed this with ''Invisible Human - Hymen Examination'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]), and retired from AV after ''Ecstasy Part 5'' ([[1989 in film|1989]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;shintoho&quot;/&gt; In [[1988 in film|1988]], Keiko became among the first Japanese adult video actresses to perform [[anal sex]] in an adult video. Keiko was also a regular feature in various Japanese erotic magazines during the mid and late-1980s. She was recognized for her work in the adult video industry when she won the third GORO Tish Madonna Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;shintoho&quot;/&gt;

Keiko Nakazawa retired in 1989 and got married and gave birth to a child not long afterward. Keiko reported in a subsequent magazine interview that [[childbirth]] was a rewarding, but strenuous experience for her. Keiko's second stage labor required nearly ten hours of rigorous pushing for her to deliver her child. This magazine interview was the final, to date, public communication from Keiko Nakazawa.

==Life and career==
Hino was born [[March 7]], [[1986]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. In July 2005 she debuted at age 19 on the [[Crystal-Eizou]] company's Venus label in the video ''G's Curiosity - Hikari Hino'' (Gの好奇心 妃乃ひかり).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2005.htm|title=2005|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal-Eizou promoted her video appearances by offering fans a chance to buy a pair of her &quot;T-Back&quot; panties in an auction ending on [[January 21]], [[2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/actress/archives/b03_auction_8.php|title=妃乃ひかりちゃんのＴバックパンティオークション！！ (''Miss Hino Hikari's T-Back Panty Auction!!'')|date=2006-01-21|accessdate=2008-01-08|work=http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/ www.crystal-eizou.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hino was the subject of two further panty-auctions in March&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/actress/archives/b03_auction_8.php|title=妃乃ひかりちゃんの水色パンティオークション！！|date=2006-03-25|accessdate=2008-01-08|work=http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/ www.crystal-eizou.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/actress/archives/b03_auction_8.php|title=妃乃ひかりちゃんのメイド風？パンティオークション！！ (''Miss Hino Hikari's Maid-Style Panty Auction!!'')|date=2006-06-18|accessdate=2008-01-08|work=http://www.crystal-eizou.jp/ www.crystal-eizou.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hino remained with [[Crystal-Eizou]] for a year, making about one video a month, before she moved on to [[Moodyz]], one of the largest studios in the Japanese porn industry, in July 2006. She has continued to make videos with Moodyz through 2009 but has also made numerous videos with several other companies as well including a number of more hardcore S&amp;M works for the [[Attackers]] and [[Dogma (studio)|Dogma]] studios. Her November 2008 video ''Roomshare'' (パイズリ狭射 トリプル痴女大乱交) was the [[Wanz Factory]] nominee in the 2009 [[AV Grand Prix]] award contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/=/cid=3avgp150|title=パイズリ狭射 トリプル痴女大乱交|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-06-15|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hino stands out in the AV field, where an average career spans about a year, with five to ten videos total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-02-18 |last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|publisher= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate =2007-03-20|quote=If she’s only out for money, she will studiously avoid publicity and quit inside a year—the average life-span of an AV girl—with five or ten videos to her credit and an unknowing family bosom to return to.

==Life and career==
===Early life and career===
Hotaru Akane was born in [[Osaka]] on 25 October 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?aknhtr00|title=紅音 ほたる - Akane Hotaru|date=2005-08-15|accessdate=2008-04-30|publisher=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic' (Idol Dictionary)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that she joined the AV industry, she was studying as a nursing student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mr. Pig|title=15 Interesting Facts about Hotaru Akane|url=http://www.sweatpig.com/facts-hotaru-akane/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204204652/http://www.sweatpig.com/facts-hotaru-akane/|archivedate=2008-02-04|publisher=[http://www.sweatpig.com/ sweatpig.com]|date=2007-07-25|accessdate=2009-05-08|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akane's early appearances were under the stage name Anna Akizuki, and she debuted in AV using this name in an ensemble performance in the February 2004 adult video (AV), ''Faithful Dog 'Saseko''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=ext015|title=Faithful Dog 'SASEKO'|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the award for Best AV Title at the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards (2000-2006)|5th Takeshi Kitano Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/tsmp/backnumber.html|title=東スポ映画大賞 過去の授賞一覧 (Tokyo Sports Film Awards - Summary)|accessdate=2008-11-16|publisher=[http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/ Tokyo Sports]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not originally a solo actress, Akane's attractiveness led to her first starring video, ''G Guy!'' in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=fe695|title=G Guy! / Anna Akitsuki|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akane's September 2004 video ''Super Idols'', rapidly achieved &quot;legendary&quot; status, and was re-released on DVD in November as the first entry in the ''Super Idols'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=ss548|title=Super Idols 1 / Anna Syugetsu|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=sds017|title=Super Idols 1 / Anna Syugetsu|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV Academy Awards' &quot;Newcomer of the Year&quot;===
The ''[[cosplay]]''-themed ''Uniform Collection / Anna Syugetsu'' had Akane donning a variety of school uniforms, a popular form of [[garment fetishism]] in AVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=god270|title=Uniform Collection / Anna Syugetsu|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''cosplay'' video, ''Sister Maid'' from December 2004, starred the prominent AV actress, Shuri Himesaki. Akane played the role of Himesaki's sister, and together they gave erotic performances in maid costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=twd133|title=Sister Maid / Syuri Himesaki・Anna Akizuki|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of her very prolific AV career, Akane says that she finds the time and energy to masturbate every day, and owns ten adult toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp/sekiryu/cast/cast.html|title=Sekiryû no onna official subsite: Cast|accessdate=2008-05-05|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp]|quote=オナニーはしますか？... 「毎日します」 (&quot;Do you masturbate?... &quot;I do it every day.&quot;) 大人のおもちゃを見せてもらうことに。...10個はありました。 (&quot;She displayed her adult toys...

In 2005, ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' recognized Akane's career by awarding her the &quot;Newcomer of the Year&quot; title in their &quot;AV Academy Awards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=紅音ほたる、エイズ問題「女の子も性に関心持って」|url=http://www.ohmynews.co.jp/news/20080415/23506|publisher=[http://www.ohmynews.co.jp/ ohmynews.co.jp]|date=2008-04-17|accessdate=2008-05-05|language=Japanese|quote=週刊プレイボーイ「AVアカデミー賞新人賞」受賞。}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also won a Best Actress Award for Excellence at the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#5th Annual SOD Awards 2006|2006 SOD Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20061216A/|title=第５回SOD大賞は範田紗々！ (5th SOD Awards)|accessdate=2008-11-19|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ All About]|language=Japanese|date=December 16, 2006|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kuki Inc.|Kuki's]] January 2006 release, ''Cutie Clips'' gave the viewer the experience of having a &quot;virtual love story&quot; with several top AV actresses. Akane's segment is a &quot;virtual date&quot; at the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=arrd008|title=Cutie Clips|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Temptation; 7 Ultimate Queens Attack Me!!'', Akane joined with [[Nana Natsume]] and five other the top AV idols of 2006 in competition for the honor of serving as top hostess at &quot;the most luxurious and the most lecherous club in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=sdms015|title=Temptation; 7 Ultimate Queens Attack Me!!|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The &quot;''Shiofuki'' Queen&quot;===
For her ability to perform ''shiofuki'' or [[female ejaculation]], Akane became known as the &quot;''Shiofuki'' Queen&quot; of Japanese adult videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiofuki-queen&quot;/&gt; Videos focusing on this talent include such titles as ''Hotaru Akane - Shiofuki Climax'' and ''Hotaru Akane - Paipan Mega Shiofuki Fuck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jans-web.com/?p=mcard&amp;id=0371|title=Hotaru Akane - Shiofuki Climax|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator 1997-2006]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jans-web.com/?p=mcard&amp;id=4776|title=Hotaru Akane - Paipan Mega Shiofuki Fuck|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator 1997-2006]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akane says that she prepares for her ''shiofuki'' demonstrations by drinking an entire bottle of water before performing in these scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp/sekiryu/cast/cast.html|title=Sekiryû no onna official subsite: Cast|accessdate=2008-05-05|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp]|quote=紅音さんは試行錯誤した結果「水を飲むと潮吹ける！」という荒技をあみ出したようです。そこで、いつも撮影前にやっていると言う「ペットボトル一気飲み」...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the June 2006 video, ''Hotaru Akane and Ayano Murasaki: Splash Heaven'', Akane competed with top ''jukujo'' or &quot;mature&quot; actress, [[Ayano Murasaki]] in this area of specialty. In a contest to decide, &quot;Who is the best squirter in the AV industry,&quot; the two actresses reportedly, &quot;splash love juice like a fountain!!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=PTV360|title=Hotaru Akane and Ayano Murasaki SPLASH HEAVEN - 115 minutes|accessdate=2008-05-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Love Splashing'', released the following month, was a ''shiofuki''-themed omnibus collection grouping Akane with such notable practitioners of the technique as [[Ai Kurosawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=rbnd110|title=LOVE Splashing! RIBON 4 Hours BEST|accessdate=2008-05-05|work=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, Akane was chosen to be the actress in the inaugural entry of the new ''Ultimate Ecstasy'' series on the Real Works label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=reca003|title=Ultimate Ecstasy, Hotaru Akane|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Akane appeared in her first &quot;uncensored&quot; video, without the mosaic pixellation which is used to disguise the genitals in most Japanese porn films. She has subsequently made four more original uncensored videos, all released by Sky High Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aventertainments.com/ActressDetail.aspx?languageID=1&amp;actressname=Hotaru+Akane|title=AV Entertainments PROFILE:Hotaru Akane|accessdate=2008-06-20|publisher=[http://www.aventertainments.com/ www.aventertainments.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akane takes pride in her career as an AV idol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp/sekiryu/cast/cast.html|title=Sekiryû no onna official subsite: Cast|accessdate=2008-05-05|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ hasesyo-et.hp.infoseek.co.jp]|quote=「仕事は仕事。プライドを持ってやっている。」 &quot;Work is work. I have pride.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, her January 2007 video, ''Gals' Battle Royal ～Hotaru Kurenai X Chihiro Shina～'', makes a theme of that professionalism. The video has two accomplished AV performers trying to outdo each other in a competition of sexual acts. Practices employed in the contest include [[fellatio]], ''[[paizuri]]'' and urination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=t28074|title=Gals' Battle Royal ～Hotaru Kurenai X Chihiro Shina～|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was re-released in [[Blu Ray]] format in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=hitma04|title=～Hotaru Kurenai X Chihiro Shina～|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar competition-themed video was ''Versus, Hotaru Akane vs. Satoko Tachibana'', which pitted Akane against another top AV idol in a competition over who is the most skilled erotic performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=dv825|title=Versus, Hotaru Akane VS.

Her success and confidence makes her the envy of her co-workers, who rejoice when she falls into a slump and is fired by the company's boss. Akane then sleeps with the head of a rival insurance company in order to be hired there. When compromising photos of Akane begin to circulate, her old co-workers again take pleasure in her humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=iesp330|title=Insurance Salesperson Raped Hard|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long and extremely prolific career, Akane released her retirement video ''Final Gusher - Akane Hotaru's Retirement Work'' with [[CROSS studio|Cross]] in October 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crosscross.jp/works/-/detail/=/cid=crpd264/|title=紅音ほたる引退作品ファイナル潮吹き顔射浣腸ぶっかけスペシャル|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[http://www.crosscross.jp/ www.crosscross.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her blog is still open and she continues a chronicle of her busy event schedule.

===Personality===
Unlike many other adult video actresses who carefully guard their private lives, Akane has kept a fairly high public profile. In addition to her AV appearances, Akane has become known as a popular blogger. Her frank blog, &quot;Hotaru's Life,&quot; quickly achieved a high blog-ranking, which it has continuously maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sekiryû no onna&quot;/&gt; In another sign of Akane's widespread media recognition, she played a role in director [[Toru Ichikawa]]'s mainstream theatrical film, {{nihongo|赤龍の女|Sekiryû no onna}} (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitchfilm.net/archives/007853.html|title=Yû Misaki &amp; Hotaru Akane in Tôru Ichikawa's SEKIRYÛ NO ONNA|accessdate=2008-05-05|publisher=[http://twitchfilm.net/ twitchfilm.net]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sekiryû no onna&quot;/&gt; As a high-profile celebrity in the sex industry, Akane was invited to speak at a &quot;World AIDS Day&quot; event in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] Ward on 1 December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=「AVのマネしないで」AV女優・紅音ほたるが呼びかけ |url=http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3419929/|publisher=[http://news.livedoor.com/ news.livedoor.com]|date=2007-12-07|accessdate=2008-04-30|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2008, Akane made her debut as a singer in a celebrity compilation CD titled ''Mero Raba (Melodic Lover)'' targeted at a female audience. She provided the lyrics for the song she sings: ''Ai no Kuni''. Other contributors to the CD include fashion models and popular singer TSUKASA, Akane is the only AV actress included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-2818|title=&quot;Gal&quot; compilation album includes AV actress| publisher=[http://www.tokyograph.com/ TokyoGraph News] |year=2008|month=March|accessdate=2008-09-01|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Mayu Kotono'''|琴野まゆ|Kotono Mayu}} is a Japanese [[AV idol]] popular for her large breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=jf589|title=The Private tutor's temptation|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Kotono was born on December 15, 1980 in [[Tokyo]], Japan. Her bust measurement is 93&amp;nbsp;cm and she wears a metric G-70 cup bra, her shoe size is 23.5&amp;nbsp;cm. She made her adult video (AV) debut in the January 2000 video {{nihongo|''Virgin Memorial''|ヴァージンメモリアル}} for [[Kuki Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2000_body.htm|title=Years / 2000|accessdate=2009-01-23|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=jf585|title=VIRGIN MEMORIAL|accessdate=2009-01-24|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon afterwards appeared in a pictorial for ''Bejean'' magazine. Four months later in May 2000, she made her first video for the Atlas21 studio, ''Body Shop''..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=a00056|title=Body Shop|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been retired from AV since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jans-web.com/profiles/n0758|title=Mayu Kotono 琴野まゆ|publisher=[http://jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator]|accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but made a number of &quot;uncensored&quot; videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avfantasy.com/search_Products.aspx?section=0&amp;searchBy=starring&amp;keyword=Mayu+Kotono&amp;StudioID=0&amp;Dept_ID=0&amp;videotype=1|title=STARRING \ Mayu Kotono |publisher=[http://www.avfantasy.com/ AV Fantasy]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (without the usual mosaic pixelation to obscure the genitals necessary in Japanese porn), including the 2006 work, ''Magic Banana Vol. 16''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aventertainments.com/product_lists.aspx?product_id=12888&amp;languageID=1&amp;Pro=Magic+Banana+Vol.+16&amp;Studio=Magic+Banana&amp;Actress=Mayu+Kotono&amp;dept_id=|title=Magic Banana Vol. 16|publisher=[http://www.aventertainments.com/ AV Entertainments]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Riko Tachibana'''|立花里子|Tachibana Riko}} ([[November 10]], [[1984]] - ) is a popular and award-winning [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[AV idol]]. Taller than average, Tachibana debuted in 2003 and starred in many adult videos which emphasized her height. An extremely prolific actress, Tachibana had performed in over 200 AVs when she was awarded for Most Appearances at Japan's [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] in 2007. Tachibana retired in March 2008.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Riko Tachibana was born in [[Tokyo]] on [[November 10]], [[1984]].&lt;ref name=&quot;xcity profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?aid=1082|title=Tachibana (Riko Tachibana)|accessdate=2008-06-21|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tachibana is tall for a Japanese woman, reportedly standing 172 cm (nearly 5' 8&quot;) in early publicity,&lt;ref name=&quot;mainichi&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Porno starlet tied to bizarre murder-suicide pact|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2002/10/20021024p2g00m0dm999000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=[[October 24]], [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; though her height was later reported to be 168 cm (5' 6&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;xcity profile&quot;/&gt; Tachibana was not comfortable with her above-average size, saying, &quot;I used to have a real inferiority complex about my height. I always thought guys liked little girls better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mainichi&quot;/&gt; Tachibana's inferiority complex began to dwindle as she noticed that many men were attracted to her because of her height, wanting her to baby them. For example, when she was in a relationship with a high-level salaryman in his 30s, he asked her to pat his head while he lay in her lap, and tell him, &quot;Good boy, good boy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mainichi&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut===
Like many AV stars, Tachibana was found by a talent scout in Shinjuku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-05-01|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2006-05-16|language=English|quote=Most careers start on the streets. Shibuya, Shinjuku and Roppongi are the hunting grounds where talent scouts prowl...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tachibana was shopping at the time, and, contrary to her usual habit, turned to hear what the scout had to say.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin Fans&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Mr. Pig|title=Virgin Fans Fuck Riko Tachibana!|url=http://www.sweatpig.com/virgin-fans-fuck-riko-tachibana|publisher=[http://www.sweatpig.com/ www.sweatpig.com]|date=[[April 4]], [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her AV debut in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin Fans&quot;/&gt; The first volume in the Hibino label's ''Women Taller Than 170cm'' series was released in November 2003, and became a huge hit with AV audiences, reflecting a demand for taller models.&lt;ref name=&quot;mainichi&quot;/&gt; Tachibana's height helped her get the starring role in the third entry in the series, released in May 2004. When interviewed for the video release, Akinori, the director of the video, commented, &quot;You've got no idea how hard it is to come up with tall actresses... the demand is just too great to fill.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mainichi&quot;/&gt;

===&quot;Riko-pin&quot;===
As she gained in popularity, Tachibana acquired a nickname, ''Riko-pin'' (リコぴん).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2007年１月16日（火）、都内某所で「日本アダルト放送大賞2007」の記者会見が開かれた。|url=http://www.adultaward.net/interview.html|publisher=[http://www.adultaward.net/ www.adultaward.net]|date=[[January 16]], [[2007]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-06-21}} (link is now dead)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin Fans&quot;/&gt; She became a notably prolific star of AVs, performing in a variety of themes and roles. Tachibana says that her favorite roles are those in the &quot;Older Sister&quot; and &quot;Perverted Woman&quot; stereotypes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin Fans&quot;/&gt;

In one of her earliest roles, Hibino's cosplay ''Super Knight Atliger'', Riko plays one of a trio of Power Ranger type heroines. In VIP label's ''Popular Old People's Home'', released in December 2004, Tachibana was part of the female staff at a rest home populated by sexually aggressive senior citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=god271|title=Popular Old People's Home|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''AV Actress Is A Receptionist'', released in January 2005, was part of a humiliation-themed series on the Hot Entertainment label. The situation, claimed to have been rehearsed for two months and employing thirty extras, has Tachibana taking a job as a receptionist at a job fair. While she is engaged in the duties of her job, an actor has sex with Tachibana from behind. The video records Tachibana's embarrassed efforts to maintain a straight face while performing her receptionist role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=het378|title=AV Actress Is A Receptionist|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Female Prisoner Amazons'' from September 2005 was a [[women in prison]]-themed DVD with Tachibana heading a large cast of AV idols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=nfxv001|title=Female Prisoner AMAZONES|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her starring role in the ninth entry in [[CineMagic Co.|CineMagic's]] ''Bondage Doll'', Tachibana underwent training designed to lead her to the pleasures of [[masochism]]. Bondage, gagging, and blind-folding ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=dvs046|title=BONDAGE DOLL IX / Riko Tachibana|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, Tachibana was again the star of a humiliation-themed DVD, ''Lesbian Teachers' Water Spanking''. In the DVD, she played the role of a teacher who is tied up and dowsed with bodily fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=14id043|title=Lesbian Teachers' Water Spanking / Riko Tachibana|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''I'm Her Pet'' from November 2006 had Tachibana in the role of the humiliator, as she embarrasses her male co-star. A scene in which Tachibana provokes her partner's genitalia with cotton swabs and a toothbrush is singled out as a highlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=rwrk179|title=I'm Her Pet, Riko Tachibana|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the many DVDs exploiting Tachibana's height, ''Tall Actresses vs. Small Actors'' joined Tachibana with eleven other tall AV idols to engage in sex with diminutive men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=godr147|title=Tall Actresses vs. Small Actors|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The October 2007 DVD, ''Lewd-1 Grand Prix'', pitted Tachibana against AV actress Noa. In the DVD, these two highly skilled AV performers compete for the title of &quot;Lewdest&quot; in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=remu009|title=Lewd-1 Grand Prix, Noa vs. Riko Tachibana &quot;Who's The Lewdest In Japan!&quot;|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two actresses were again paired in the January 2008 DVD, ''Double Dream Super Special'', this time working together, rather than in competition, in lesbian-themed performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=real289|title=Double Dream Super Special, Noa, Riko Tachibana|accessdate=2008-06-27|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html XCity]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career recognition and retirement===
Within four years of her debut, Tachibana had appeared in over 200 titles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin Fans&quot;/&gt; a remarkably large number considering the average AV actress appears in only five to ten videos in her entire career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-05-12|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2007-03-20|quote=If she’s only out for money, she will studiously avoid publicity and quit inside a year-the average life-span of an AV girl-with five or ten videos to her credit and an unknowing family bosom to return to.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of her highly prolific career, Tachibana was given the award for Most Appearances at Japan's [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adult Broadcasting Awards&quot;/&gt; When accepting the award, Tachibana impressed the audience by lifting her dress and squatting with her legs apart. She promised the crowd that she would continue her work in the industry, saying, &quot;I still want to make other people orgasm, and me as well. So why don't we orgasm together again?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adult Broadcasting Awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigempire.com/sake/honoka_adult.html|title=Honoka Takes Top Prize at Adult Broadcasting Awards|accessdate=2008-06-21|publisher=[http://www.bigempire.com/ www.bigempire.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tachibana acted her favored &quot;Perverted Women&quot; role for the last time in her farewell video, released on the Real Works label in March 2008. In the title of the video, an entry in the &quot;Perverted Woman from Hell&quot; series, Tachibana proclaimed herself the &quot;Eternal Strongest Perverted Woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/=/cid=172emu028/|title=地獄痴女スペシャル 引退・立花里子 私が永遠の最強痴女よ！|accessdate=2008-06-26|language=Japanese|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ dmm.co.jp/]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an incident that shocked the nation, she was murdered at the age of 24.&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide pact&quot;/&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Nozomi Momoi was born in [[Tokyo]] on September 23 of either 1978 or 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;birth&quot;/&gt; She attended junior high school in [[Nagano Prefecture]], and remained in touch with friends there, visiting them on vacation, for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide pact&quot;/&gt; Before beginning work in the AV field, Nozomi worked in what she called &quot;a very normal job.&quot; Describing her daily routine at this time, she said, &quot;I used to wake up at 5:30 in the morning to get ready for work and I didn't have time to put on make-up or do my hair... It was the type of job where I was alone most of the time so I didn't bother with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; She wanted a different lifestyle, and to make more money, but she was unable to decide what sort of work she wanted to do. She was in this frame of mind when she was scouted by a representative of the AV industry in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Shinjuku]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; 

===AV debut===
When she made her AV debut in April 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2001.htm|title=2001|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; AV director [[Tohjiro]]'s advice to Nozomi was, &quot;You should be a bit more perverted.&quot; Nozomi claimed that she took this advice to heart and that it helped her to be less inhibited both on screen and off.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; In December of her debut year, Nozomi was the star of the fourth entry in VIP studios' documentary-style ''Monthly'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=VIP103|title=''Monthly Nozomi Momoi''|accessdate=2007-07-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Her January 2002 video, ''Virtual Brothel'' had Nozomi playing the role of a young prostitute who learns the trade from the more experienced Yukari Sakurada. Viewers were invited to compare Sakurada's veteran technique with Nozomi's fresh innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=BZ84|title=''Virtual Brothel''|accessdate=2007-07-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nozomi enjoyed her new occupation. About her early videos, Nozomi recalled, &quot;I was having so much fun at first that I didn't feel tired at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; Unlike many AV actresses who are happy to have time off, Nozomi became known for actively seeking out new chances to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Porno starlet tied to bizarre murder-suicide pact|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2002/10/20021024p2g00m0dm999000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060109005947/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2002/10/20021024p2g00m0dm999000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=October 24, 2002|archivedate=2006-01-09|accessdate=2007-10-10|quote=...a porno industry source tells Asahi Geino... 'Nozomi was also keen on working. Where most other girls in this business are glad not to have work, she was well known for going around asking for her next job.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of 2002, Nozomi appeared in the third entry of the ''Forceful Exhibitionistic-Play Maniax'' video series. In this video, Nozomi and two other AV actresses engage in exhibitionistic acts at a [[pachinko]] parlor, a public park, and an office building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forceful Exhibitionistic-Play Maniax&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=CAO026|title=''Forceful Exhibitionistic-Play Maniax 3''|accessdate=2007-07-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Towards the end of her life, she had become tired of the rape themes and school-girl roles which were common in her videos, but she enjoyed the fact that she was getting more dominant roles in her later AVs. &quot;Making men play along to me is something new so it's fun to do. I think that's the type of thing I want to do more of.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; Nozomi's July, 2002 video release, ''Popular Actresses Fucking Virgin Boys'', was in this genre. As the title implied, the video had Nozomi and two other AV actresses have sex with amateur virgin males, including a college student and a middle-aged man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forceful Exhibitionistic-Play Maniax&quot;/&gt; Her video ''Home Delivery Call Girl'', from August 2002, worked with a similar documentary-style concept. In this case, the actress appears at a male amateur's home to perform sex with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=A02082|title=''Home Delivery Call Girl''|accessdate=2007-07-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A posthumously-released compilation DVD from 2006, entitled ''La Vie En Nose'', includes one of Nozomi's videos. This was the first in a series of DVDs focusing on a nose fetish, indicating that Nozomi had worked in that genre also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DD202|title=''La Vie En Nose''|accessdate=2007-07-05|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nozomi continued to enjoy sex both within and outside of the AV setting, and stated that she didn't mind having it every day.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, &quot;...it was a lot of fun at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; She continued, &quot;Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate_interview&quot;/&gt; A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress.&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide pact&quot;/&gt; In another sign that she was seeking to expand her career out of the AV industry, Nozomi formed a musical group with some other AV idols, and released a musical CD in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide pact&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
Nozomi's career was still on the rise when her life came to a sudden end while visiting Nagano Prefecture. On October 12, 2002, she was found dead by the Narai River, which runs through [[Shiojiri]]. A nearby burned-out car contained the remains of her male companion.&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide pact&quot;/&gt; Nozomi had been stabbed at least six times, covered with gasoline and set on fire about 10 meters from the car. Nozomi's killer was a company employee in Nagano Prefecture. In what the police called a possible murder-suicide pact, the killer also burned himself to death inside the car. The remains were so badly charred that it took hours of testing before investigators could even determine that the remains belonged to a male. According to the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'', &quot;Nozomi seemed to have something Japan's myriad other porno starlets lacked and, at just 24, she was on her way up in the world before her tragic end.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide pact&quot;/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Sakura Sakurada'''|桜田さくら|Sakurada Sakura}} is a popular Japanese adult video actress. She has also used the name {{nihongo|'''Sakura Matsui'''|松井さくら}} for still photo shoots. In Japan, these actresses are referred to as [[AV Idol]]s. 
==Life and career==
===Early career - &quot;Uncensored Movies&quot;===
''[[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]]'' has described Sakura Sakurada as having &quot;a fantastic body - lithe, but totally buxom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avn.com/movies/58240.html|last=Katz|first=Nathalie|title=''Welcome Back Sakura'' (review)|month=April|year=2005|accessdate=2008-09-05|work=[[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making her AV debut in 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;nx1020&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nx1020.com/actress/sa/sa-003.htm|title=桜田さくら プロフィール (Sakurada Sakura profile)|accessdate=2007-04-06|format= |work=www.nx1020.com/|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Sakurada became known for starring in so-called &quot;uncensored movies&quot; i.e. the genitalia are not [[Pixelization|pixilated]] to disguise them. This technique, known as &quot;[[Fogging (censorship)|fogging]],&quot; or &quot;mosaic&quot; is used in most Japanese porn movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryann|last=Connell|title=Exposed genitalia makes breakthrough on Japan's silver screens|authorlink=Ryann Connell|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/news/20061204p2g00m0dm003000c.html|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|publisher= |date=2005-08-05|accessdate=2007-04-06|quote=Japan's Eirin, the name commonly used for the Administration Commission of Motion Picture Code of Ethics, has traditionally taken a hard line against the display of reproductive organs on celluloid, requiring moviemakers to blot them out of view by using a digital mosaic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakurada has appeared in about 40 original &quot;uncensored movies&quot; in her career but that figure has been greatly magnified by numerous re-releases, compilations and online pay-per-view and streaming versions.&lt;ref&gt;Including {{cite web|url=http://www.1pondo.tv/list_search.php?q=%BA%F9%C5%C4%A4%B5%A4%AF%A4%E9|title=Sakura Sakurada on1pondotv website|accessdate=2008-09-05|publisher=[http://www.1pondo.tv www.1pondo.tv]|language=Japanese}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancom.com/listpages2/sakurada_sakura.htm|title=Sakura Sakurada on caribbeancom website|accessdate=2008-09-05|publisher=[http://www.caribbeancom.com/ www.caribbeancom.com/]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides performing in numerous films in the more common genres, such as [[bukkake]], [[gokkun]], [[creampie (sexual act)|naka-dashi]], sex in public, and erotic [[cosplay]], Sakurada has also performed in several unusual projects. Among these, she has taken part in a number of fetish productions (primarily for Giga in 2003 and 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.giga-freeks.net/new/giga/html/actress_eng/profile/sakuradasakura.htm| title=Giga-Freeks Profile Sakura Sakurada|accessdate=2008-09-28|publisher=[http://www.giga-freeks.net www.giga-freeks.net]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring [[scat]] and [[omorashi]] (watersports). In one video for Natural High (''Hot Horny Shemales Fucking Crazy'') her costars were two transsexual woman actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.naturalhigh.co.jp/r1/detailes.php?id=NHDT-091| title=Naturalhigh Official Web Site - Title Details|accessdate=2008-06-14|publisher=[http://www.naturalhigh.co.jp/ www.naturalhigh.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also made a video (''Mother-Daughter Rice Bowl'') with an actress, Satsuki Sakurada, who is identified as her mother and who also performs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marx.co.jp/works/detail.cgi?id=62|title=母子どんぶり号泣乱交 (Mother-Daughter Rice Bowl)|accessdate=2008-04-26|publisher=[http://www.marx.co.jp/ www.marx.co.jp]|language=Japanese|quote=娘はベテランＡＶ女優。片や、母は新人ＡＶ女... 母・さつき... 娘・さくら... (Daughter is a veteran AV actress, partner and mother is a new AV woman... Mother: Satsuki... Daughter: Sakura)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second video (see ''Incest Chapter'' released [[2004-11-01]] in the Filmography) they appear only in separate scenes. In addition, she has appeared in one film (''The Dog Game'') involving rape and a scene of [[bestiality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.av1.jp/detail.php?no=MAXD-04|title=The Dog Game|accessdate=2008-04-26|publisher=[http://www.av1.jp/list.php?top AV1 Alpha International]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
After a brief retirement in mid-2005, she returned to the adult video scene but from that point appeared almost exclusively in &quot;censored&quot; movies - she has not done an original &quot;uncensored&quot; video since late 2005. Many of her movies since then have been lesbian oriented and several have had [[Sadomasochism]] and [[Bondage (BDSM)]] themes, including the [[Attackers#Series|''Les Noir'']] series and others for [[Attackers]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.attackers.net/cgi-bin/search/msearch.cgi?query=%BA%F9%C5%C4%A4%B5%A4%AF%A4%E9+les-noir|title={{nihongo2|キーワード：桜田さくら les-noir}} (Search on Sakura Sakurada les-noir)|accessdate=2008-04-26|publisher=[http://www.attackers.net/ www.attackers.net]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these videos, she often appears as the older woman dominating younger girls or men. For most of her career, Sakurada has been a freelance performer not connected with any one studio, but since early 2006, she has been closely associated with the video producer [[Cross (studio)|Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crosscross.jp/works/-/list/=/article=actress/id=7581/|title={{nihongo2|桜田さくら作品一覧}} (List of Sakura Sakurada products)|accessdate=2008-04-26|publisher=[http://www.crosscross.jp/top.html www.crosscross.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In March 2008 she made her debut with them as a director in the DVD ''The Maniac Lesbians' Filming Party''.

Sakurada's other recent activity has been for the new label Zeus, a division of Giga, the studio for which she did a number of fetish videos early in her career. Zeus specializes in fetish material including Heroine torture, [[scat]], enemas, and [[omorashi]]. She has starred in two of their videos, ''Sadi-Scream Vol. 4'' and ''Heroine Cruel Story Vol. 7'' which indulge in torture, gore and copious amounts of fake blood, with little or no sex content. Additionally, she has also played minor non-sex, non-scat roles in several other Zeus videos in 2008, especially in their &quot;Heroine Excretion Hell&quot; series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeus-web.net/index02.html|title=Zeus Website|accessdate=2008-07-27|publisher=[http://www.zeus-web.net/ www.zeus-web.net]|language=Japanese &amp; English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, her appearances as an actress in 2008 and 2009 have been very limited and mostly in lesbian roles.

===Other activities===
In addition to her hardcore career, Sakurada has also acted in a number of softcore films, including starring in direct-to-video [[V-Cinema]] and theatrical [[Pink film]]. In three of her softcore films, she worked with noted Japanese erotic and horror film director [[Naoyuki Tomomatsu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1381841/|title=IMDB - Naoyuki Tomomatsu|accessdate=2008-06-28|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ www.imdb.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in another with cult horror and science-fiction director Daisuke Yamanouchi (山内大輔).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1399618/|title=IMDB - Daisuke Yamanouchi|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ www.imdb.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, Sakurada was cited in an article on AV idol-[[blog|bloggers]] as a member of that group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kemuta |last= Ōtsubo|url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/nlbn/NL000500/vl_35.htm|title=女優ブログから、今度は女優SNS？(ガイドメールマガジンバックナンバー Vol.35)|date=2005-12-12|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ allabout.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-03-26|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakurada demonstrated her singing abilities in the [[Cross (studio)|Cross]] hardcore video ''3 Days Recording Training Camp with AV Actress Rock Band'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscross.jp/works/-/detail/=/cid=crpd055/|title={{nihongo2|AV女優ロックバンドとイク！！レコーディング合宿3日間}} (3 Days Recording Training Camp with AV Actress Rock Band)|accessdate=2008-07-22|publisher=[http://www.crosscross.jp www.crosscross.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot involves the training of an all-girl rock band &quot;The Skinless&quot; and finishes with the four actresses performing a music video of a song &quot;Body and Soul&quot; with lyrics and vocals by Sakura Sakurada.

===Popularity and recognition===
It is a measure of the fame that her uncensored movies have brought her in countries outside of Japan that author [[Stephen Hunter]] uses a fictionalized Sakurada as a character in his 2007 novel, ''The 47th Samurai''. The character &quot;Sakura&quot; appears in Hunter's novel while filming the video ''Woman Teacher in Black Sakura,'' one of the real-life Sakurada's works. Hunter knows Sakurada's work well enough to make reference to the gap in her front teeth in her early videos which disappeared in later appearances. In the acknowledgements section of the novel, he also acknowledges Sakurada as one of his muses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunter|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Hunter|title=The 47th Samurai: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel|pages=pp.140-143, 371.|year=2007|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=New York|isbn=0-743238-09-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another instance of Sakurada's popularity in the United States, her video ''Sakura's Squirt Tunnel Adventures'' (released in the US by Oriental Dream Pictures) was nominated in the category &quot;Best Ethnic-Themed Release, Asian&quot; at the 2008 Annual [[AVN Award|AVN Awards Show]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avnawards.com/index.php?content=nominees|title=AVN Awards Nominees|accessdate=2008-09-10|publisher=[http://www.avnawards.com/ www.avnawards.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakura Sakurada is also notably prolific for a Japanese AV actress. The average career of an AV actress in Japan spans about one year, during which the actress will appear in five to ten videos total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-04-06 |last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|publisher= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate =2007-03-20|quote=If she’s only out for money, she will studiously avoid publicity and quit inside a year—the average life-span of an AV girl—with five or ten videos to her credit and an unknowing family bosom to return to.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakurada's career has spanned over five years during which she has appeared in some 250 original videos reaching a peak in 2004 when she was in nearly 100 titles.

{{nihongo|'''Mayura Hoshitsuki or Mayura Hoshizuki'''|星月まゆら|Hoshitsuki Mayura}} is an award-winning Japanese adult video actress. Her extended career, popularity and impressive filmography qualify her as an [[AV idol]].

==Life and career==
Hoshitsuki made her AV debut in August 2002 with the [[Crystal-Eizou]] company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2002.htm|title=2002|accessdate=2009-07-06|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV {{nihongo2|研究所}} (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her video appearances were rather limited in her early years. Starting in 2004, her career blossomed and her DVD list at Amazon now numbers 164.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_d?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Ddvd&amp;field-keywords=%90%AF%8C%8E%82%DC%82%E4%82%E7&amp;x=16&amp;y=21] search at amazon.co.jp [[September 14]], [[2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; From early in her career, Hoshitsuki has been involved in videos portraying most of the standard genres of Japanese pornography: [[bukakke]], [[gokkun]], public nudity and sex, [[bondage (BDSM)]], and [[cosplay]]. Because of her petite staure and youthful looks, she has also been featured in  a number of &quot;schoolgirl&quot; and &quot;lolita&quot; videos.

Although she made her first video with the [[Dogma studio]] and director [[TOHJIRO]] in 2004 (''Confinement Chair Trance'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=DDT-095&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=download&amp;next=3|title=Dogma - DDT-095|accessdate=2008-09-19|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;, she did not become a contract actress at Dogma until 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exclusive&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/tinyd2/index.php?id=1|title=Exclusive Dogma Actresses - Mayura Hoshitsuki |accessdate=2008-09-23|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her work is now done with Dogma which is known for its sometimes bizarre fetish movies, often containing scenes of forced [[fellatio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=89|title=JAV News - Popular Series and Actors from Dogma Studio|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]|month=August|year=2008|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoshitsuki has participated in several extreme fetish videos for Dogma. The 2006 video ''Lolita Sperm Lesbians'' counts 132 ejaculations while for the 2008 video ''Vomit Lesbian Drug'', director TOHJIRO awarded her and her co-star the &quot;medal of vomit fetishists&quot; and said: &quot;No one can make better puke porn than this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=DDT-154&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=download&amp;next=1|title=Dogma - Lolita Bukakke Lesbians|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jans-web.com/?p=mcard&amp;id=4703 |title=Akane Mochida - Vomit Lesbian Drug|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had lactation scenes in two early 2008 titles, ''Ero Pop Girl'' and ''Soft And Dirty - Mayura’s Wank Navigator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=DDT-172&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=download&amp;next=0|title=Dogma - Soft And Dirty - Mayura’s Wank Navigator|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another film (''10 Year Special Lessons In Secret Technique Men’s Bible Vol. 1''), she and other Dogma actresses get lessons in the technique of [[female ejaculation|squirting]] (''shiofuki'' in Japanese porn) from the expert, actor [[Taka Kato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/=/cid=ddt185/|title=Dogma - 10 Year Special Lessons In Secret Technique Men’s Bible Vol. 1|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in a live SM-Night show with other Dogma studio actresses (she is the leader of the group known as director [[TOHJIRO]]'s M (Masochist) Women) for 200 Dogma fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Exclusive&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/7m/sm_night/loft.html |title={{nihongo2|『SMナイト』}}[SM Naito]|accessdate=2008-09-18|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2nd D-1 Climax Awards 2006|D-1 Climax Award]] ceremony in 2006, Hoshitsuki was given the ''Erotic Cinderella'' (エロシンデレラ) award for Best Actress, along with [[Chihiro Hasegawa]] and [[Maki Tomoda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/d-1/openrepo/report3.html|title={{nihongo2|第3回}} D-1 CLIMAX Official Site|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ D-1 Climax Official Site]|language=Japanese|quote={{nihongo2|星月まゆら、長谷川ちひろ、友田真希の歴代エロシンデレラが選ぶ 【ベスト女優賞】瞳れん。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2005 film ''M Drug - Female Meat Toilet - Mayura Hoshitsuki'' won the
Grand Prize at the first [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#1st D-1 Climax Awards 2005|D-1 Climax Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Exclusive&quot;/&gt; Another of her videos ''Dream School 10'', done with 7 other actresses, was the [[Moodyz]] entry in the 2006 [[AV Open]] Contest. For her performance in the ''[[pink film]]'' {{nihongo|Newlywed's Sex Education: The Uniform's Bride|新婚性教育　制服の花嫁|Shinkonseikyōiku: seifuku no hanayome}} Hoshitsuki was given a Best New Actress award at the 2006 [[Pink Grand Prix]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Toda|first=Miho||url=http://www.walkerplus.com/movie/report/report4823.html|title={{nihongo|&quot;Pink&quot; Films Seen with Great Excitement on the Shinbungeiza Theater's Big Screen!

Hoshitsuki didn't work for four months in 2006-2007 because she was &quot;recuperating on doctor's orders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=DDT-166&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=download&amp;next=1|title=Dogma - Underarm Hair Drug - The Dream Of A Girl With Underarm Hair|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, her video appearances have been limited. She released her first uncensored video - one in which the genitals are not obscured by pixellation as in most Japanese pornography - in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xonair.com/detail.cfm?id=10086668|title=X On Air - Top Idol Vol. 1 (Mayura Hoshizuki) (pf001) (DVD - 2008)|accessdate=2008-09-15|publisher=[http://www.xonair.com/ www.xonair.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoshitsuki is an ardent blogger and her extensive official blog dates back to April 2005 with frank discussions of her life and health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/mayura55/|title=Mayura Hoshitsuki - Livedoor Blog|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://blog.livedoor.jp Livedoor Blog]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is an animal lover: snakes, horses, tortoises, dogs and cats, etc, and her blog often has pictures of her pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mayura.dogma.co.jp/profile/|title=Mayura Hoshitsuki - Dogma Profile|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://mayura.dogma.co.jp Mayura's Page]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Chihiro Hasegawa'''|長谷川ちひろ|Hasegawa Chihiro}} (born [[September 23]], [[1984]]), also known as '''Nami Funakura''' (船倉奈美), is a popular and award-winning [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[AV idol]] who has starred in many AVs on various labels (a search on Amazon reveals 180 videos listed for her).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_d?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Ddvd&amp;field-keywords=%92%B7%92J%90%EC%82%BF%82%D0%82%EB%2C] search at amazon.co.jp [[September 18]], [[2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Hasegawa began her adult video career in 2004 in unusual fashion for a new AV actress - her first movies involved [[anal sex]] (''Loli PaiPan M Anal'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/monthly/playgirl/-/detail/=/cid=3ia101/|title=DMM - ちょ～かわいい長谷川ちひろの*ロ○ータパイパンMアナル* |accessdate=2008-09-19|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[urolagnia|watersports]] (''Urination Class'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/monthly/playgirl/-/detail/=/cid=42vspds011/ |title=DMM - 排尿教室 水野礼子 |accessdate=2008-09-19|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bestiality]] (''Beast King 11'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gloryquest.tv/public_html/detail.html?id=gq_mad-20&amp;PHPSESSID=896de8c6e36c8862adb7574c85a627f4|title=GloryQuest Official Site MAD-20 |accessdate=2008-09-19|publisher=[http://www.gloryquest.tv/ www.gloryquest.tv]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although she has also made a number of more mainstream adult videos in her career, Hasegawa has often been involved in the more unusual aspects of Japanese pornography from mixed urine and semen drinking (''Drink Urine Depth Charge and Gokkun W Maid'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/D_BANK/2007FEB/beejin-00238.html|title=Drink Urine Depth Charge|accessdate=2008-09-20|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/ www.jsexnetwork.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an appearance in one movie (''Chihiro Hasegawa - New Half and I'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/=/cid=krfv020/|title=DMM - 僕と長谷川ちひろとニューハーフ 女同士の嫉妬？密室劇場、世にも奇妙な三角関係。|accessdate=2008-09-19|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a transsexual actress, Moe.

Beginning in 2005 she made a number of movies with the Japanese AV studio [[Dogma studio|Dogma]] which is known for its extreme fetish videos which include bondage, urination, [[fisting]], forced [[fellatio]], and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=89|title=JAV News - Popular Series and Actors from Dogma Studio|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]|month=August|year=2008|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in most of the Dogma series including playing a &quot;hermaphrodite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=DDN-153&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=download&amp;next=0|title=Dogma - Hermaphrodite Lesbian 3|accessdate=2008-09-14|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hasegawa also participated in a live SM-Night show with other Dogma studio actresses - known as director [[TOHJIRO]]'s M (Masochist) Women - for 200 Dogma fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/7m/sm_night/loft.html|title={{nihongo2|『SMナイト』}}[SM Naito]|accessdate=2008-09-18|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, at the second [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2nd D-1 Climax Awards 2006|D-1 Climax Award]] ceremony, Hasegawa was given the ''Erotic Cinderella'' (エロシンデレラ) award for Best Actress, along with [[Maki Tomoda]] and [[Mayura Hoshitsuki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/htmls/d-1/openrepo/report3.html|title=第3回 D-1 CLIMAX Official Site|accessdate=2008-09-18|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ D-1 Climax Official Site]|language=Japanese|quote=星月まゆら、長谷川ちひろ、友田真希の歴代エロシンデレラが選ぶ 【ベスト女優賞】瞳れん。}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2007 Dogma video ''Best of Chihiro Hasegawa'' commemorated this award with scenes from 5 of her earlier movies and a 30 minute interview (&quot;'Each film is very special to me,' says Chihiro&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dogma.co.jp/modules/webshop/serch.php?dat=5&amp;serch=DDT-160&amp;sy=1&amp;pd=download&amp;next=0|title=Dogma - Best of Chihiro Hasegawa|accessdate=2008-09-18|publisher=[http://www.dogma.co.jp/ www.dogma.co.jp]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, one of her videos, ''Dream School 10'', done with 7 other actresses, was the Moodyz entry in the 2006 [[AV Open]] contest where it took the 2nd Place Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20060712A/index.htm|title=速報！AV OPEN結果発表 (Preliminary AV Open results)|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ All About]|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|date=July 12, 2006|accessdate=2008-10-01|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chihiro Hasegawa announced her retirement from the adult video industry and closed her official blog in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/chihiro661/
|title=Chihiro Hasegawa Official Blog|accessdate=2008-09-17|publisher=[http://blog.livedoor.jp/ blog.livedoor.jp] |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she did release two lesbian titles ''Shaved Lesbian Special Edition'' and ''School Girl Lesbian Vol.1'' in January 2009.

Apart from her hardcore career, Hasegawa also had a small part in Episode 4 of the [[TV Asahi]] romantic comedy series アンナさんのおまめ (Anna-san no Omame)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1027778//|title=IMDb - &quot;Anna san no omame&quot; (2006)|accessdate=2008-09-21|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &quot;The Best Friend of Beautiful Anna&quot;, in the Fall of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://talent-schedule.jp/Drama_39592|title=Talent Schedule アンナさんのおまめ|accessdate=2008-09-21|publisher=[http://talent-schedule.jp/ talent-schedule.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tisen.jp/pukiwiki/index.php?%A5%A2%A5%F3%A5%CA%A4%B5%A4%F3%A4%CE%A4%AA%A4%DE%A4%E1|title=アンナさんのおまめ |accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=[http://tisen.jp/pukiwiki/ tisen.jp/pukiwiki]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Yuma Asami'''|麻美ゆま|Asami Yuma}} is a Japanese adult video actress. Beginning in 2005 Asami appeared in AVs for [[Alice Japan]] and [[S1 No. 1  Style]]. Her adult videos have won first prize in [[Japanese Adult Video Awards]], and she has won awards as an adult actress. She has also appeared in soft-core &quot;gravure&quot; videos, [[V-Cinema]], ''[[pink film]]''s and TV dramas.

==Life and career==
===S1 and Alice Japan===
Asami was born in Tokyo on March 24, 1987 and made her AV debut in October 2005 at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2005.htm|title=2005|accessdate=2009-07-06|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been under contract from 2005 with two large Japanese AV studios, [[Alice Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alicejapan.co.jp/actress.php?actress_id=96ad56c1dbbc6ebefc58593d622861a2
|title=Alice Japan Official Website - Yuma Asami|accessdate=2008-09-24|publisher=[http://www.alicejapan.co.jp/ www.alicejapan.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[S1 No. 1 Style]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.s1s1s1.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=15365/
|title=S1 Website - Yuma Asami|accessdate=2008-09-24|publisher=[http://www.s1s1s1.com/ www.s1s1s1.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She has made about one movie a month for each of them since the beginning of her career. Most of her videos with S1 have been with director [[Hideto Aki]]. Both studios specialize in the &quot;softer&quot; type of pornography with straight sex scenes involving a solo actress, little or no storyline, and an avoidance of the more extreme activities of Japanese porn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=26

Asami has been involved with a number of unusual projects for [[Alice Japan]], mostly with director KENGO. Among these are ''Amateur Actor Audition - Yuma Asami'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlist.com/PRODUCT/DV834
|title=JList - DV834   AV Actor Audition -- Yuma Asami|accessdate=2008-09-26|publisher=[http://www.jlist.com/ www.jlist.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2007, where she interviews 10 potential AV actors between the ages of 19 and 41 and tests their abilities by having sex with them. On the opposite side of the coin, in the 2008 video ''AV Actress Audition - Yuma Asami'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlist.com/PRODUCT/DV939
|title=JList - DV834   AV Actress Audition -- Yuma Asami|accessdate=2008-09-26|publisher=[http://www.jlist.com/ www.jlist.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; she acts as the company rep interviewing 10 aspiring actresses. She has them disrobe, masturbate, and even take part in [[fellatio]] and sex scenes with actors with some coaching in technique from Asami. In another video from 2008 (''Number One Idol Yuma Asami Produce Real Virgins'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlist.com/PRODUCT/DV907

===Softcore films===
Outside of her hardcore video activities, Asami has also made several &quot;gravure&quot; videos, which are essentially glamour films which may include nudity but no sexual acts. (See the Filmography for details)

She was the star of the softcore direct-to-video ([[V-Cinema]]) erotic action flick {{nihongo|''Ninja She Devil''|妖艶くノ一伝 ～鍔女篇|Yoen kunoichi den tsubame hen}} directed by [[Yoshikazu Katō]] and released by GP Museum in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=DMSM-6872

The 12 week series aired on [[TV Tokyo]] beginning in April 2006.

{{nihongo|'''Rin Aoki'''|青木りん|Aoki Rin}} is a popular Japanese model and adult video actress. She began as a [[Gravure idol]] and later moved to hardcore video work. Her extraordinary bust, which has been reported at various times as anywhere from an H-cup to an K-cup, helped her to become both an acclaimed model and an award-winning [[AV idol]].

==Life and career==
===Gravure Idol===
Aoki was born in [[Yamagata Prefecture]] on February 28, 1985. She was first scouted in [[Harajuku]] as a gravure model in 2002 at the age of 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/busty-japanese-av-model-aoki-rin-%E9%9D%92%E6%9C%A8%E3%82%8A%E3%82%93/|title=Busty Japanese AV model Aoki Rin 青木りん|month=September|year=2007|accessdate=2008-09-29|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first gravure video, ''Burst'', appeared in 2003 and she soon became a popular [[Gravure idol]]. After two years as a glamour model, Aoki decided to enter the adult video scene and signed with the major Japanese AV company [[S1 No. 1 Style]], one of the [[Hokuto Corporation]] group of companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.s1s1s1.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=15687/
|title=S1 Website - Rin Aoki|accessdate=2008-09-29|publisher=[http://www.s1s1s1.com/ www.s1s1s1.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that her contract guaranteed her an estimated 13,000,000 yen (about $130,000), a sum greatly above the average even for top AV idols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ameba.jp/2007/05/4558.php
|title=アイドルのAV転向は「お金のため」だけなのか (Converting to an AV Idol - for the money?)|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[http://news.ameba.jp/ Ameba News]|date=May 8, 2007|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV Actress===
Her first AV production with S1, ''K-cup Active Idol Risky Mosaic'',  appeared in May 2006 and was directed by [[Hideto Aki]] who also directed most of her subsequent videos with S1. She says she was comfortable with her first AV work but was embarrassed about showing her nipples because they were small and pale colored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20060502A/index.htm
|title=現役アイドル青木りんＡＶデビューの真相 (The truth about the AV Idol debut of Rin Aoki)|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ All About]|date=May 2, 2006|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; After making ten original videos with S1 in almost a year, she left the studio along with [[Maria Ozawa]] and other fellow S1 actresses to join the startup company Das. In contrast to S1 which specializes in the &quot;softer&quot; type of pornography with mostly straightforward boy-girl sex scenes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=26
|title=JAV News - Things to Know about S1 Studio |month=August|year=2008|accessdate=2008-09-24|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Das videos ventured into more extreme areas such as simulated [[rape]], [[Creampie (sexual act)|creampie]] and [[urolagnia|watersports]]. Aoki starred in the first video of the DAS series DASD, ''20 Shots Creampie!'', released on April 25, 2007. She has made 6 more movies for Das including her first inter-racial role in the Das &quot;Black Gang Rape&quot; series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/index.php/black-males-x-japanese-females-adult-video-series/

By August 2008, Aoki was with a new start-up studio, OPPAI, which publicized her first video for them, ''108cm Kcup Rin'', with a signing and modeling event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dmm.co.jp/kouhou/oppai_kouhou/archives/064487.html|title=OPPAI (おっぱい)初イベントレポート (Oppai First Event Report)|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[http://blog.dmm.co.jp blog.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although continuing to make movies for OPPAI, she has also appeared in videos for [[Attackers]] and yet another new studio, Ranmaru.

===Popularity and Recognition===
Aoki is one of the latest examples of the very popular genre of &quot;Big-Bust&quot; models in the Japanese AV industry going back to [[Kimiko Matsuzaka]]. As a measure of her popularity in Japan, the listing of the top 100 actresses by sales from the DMM website shows Aoki ranked #3 in 2006 and #9 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/ranking/=/mode=year/aetas=2006/article=actress/rank=1_20

Aoki had a small preview appearance in the S1 compilation video ''Hyper – Barely There Mosaic'' (ハイパーギリギリモザイク) with AV idols [[Sora Aoi]], [[Yua Aida]], [[Yuma Asami]], [[Maria Ozawa]] and [[Honoka]] which won the 2006 [[AV Open]] competition among Japanese porn studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/japans-av-open-contest-2008/|title=Japan’s AV Open contest 2008|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|month=June|year=2008|language=English}} The original source http://www.av-open.com/ranking/index.html is closed.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#7th Takeshi Kitano Awards (2006)|7th annual Takeshi Kitano Entertainment Awards]] for 2006 sponsored by the Japanese tabloid newspaper ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' (東京スポーツ), Aoki was honored with the Star AV Actress Award (主演AV女優賞).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/tsmp/movie.htm

{{nihongo|'''Honoka'''|穂花|Honoka}} is an award-winning Japanese [[adult video]] (AV) actress and popular TV personality and actress. She retired from the AV industry in 2008.

==Life and career==
Honoka was born in  [[Tarumizu, Kagoshima]] , [[Japan]] on June 20, 1983. She is a [[licensed practical nurse]] and has appeared as a [[race queen]] at the 2004 Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race (July 2004). She plays the guitar, enjoys swimming and volleyball, going to [[Kabuki]] theatre and walking her dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;OzawaOffice&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mac.com/ozawaoffice/iWeb/Site/honoka.html|title=Booking Department - Honoka|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=[http://web.mac.com/ozawaoffice/ Ozawa Office Talent Agency]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/model.cfm?actress_filename=honoka|title=ActionJAV - Honoka|accessdate=2008-10-14|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like fellow [[AV Idol]]s [[Sora Aoi]] and [[Nana Natsume]], she has been able to combine a career as an AV actress with mainstream movie and TV appearances.

Before she started in AV, Honoka had a small role as a female android secretary in the [[TV Tokyo]] [[cosplay]] drama ''The Ultimate Venus Angel Healing Force'' (究極癒し戦隊ヴィーナスエンジェル) which she was in from February 16 to March 29, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://qvarie.hp.infoseek.co.jp/var/minor/venusang.htm|title=究極癒し戦隊ヴィーナスエンジェル|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=[http://qvarie.hp.infoseek.co.jp/ Tqvarie.hp.infoseek.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV actress===
Honoka began her adult video career in June 2004 with the studio Try-Heart on their Sexia label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexia.tv/actress/-/detail/=/id=9537/|title=Honoka Try-Heart Profile &amp; Filmography|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=[http://www.sexia.tv/ www.sexia.tv]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made 10 videos with Try-Heart over the next 18 months including a six month hiatus at the end of 2005 when she made no videos. In March 2006, she debuted with videos for two new AV studios, at [[S1 No. 1 Style]] with ''Sell Debut x Risky Mosaic'', directed by [[Hideto Aki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.s1s1s1.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=9537/|title=Honoka S1 Profile &amp; Filmography|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=[http://www.s1s1s1.com/ www.s1s1s1.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/D_BANK/2006MAY/debut.html|title=Honoka|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/ JSexNetwork]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Deep Impact - Honoka Sell Debut'' for the Premium Glamour label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premium-beauty.com/works/-/list/=/article=actress/id=9537/|title=Honoka Premium Profile &amp; Filmography|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=[http://www.premium-beauty.com/ www.premium-beauty.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued working with the two studios usually appearing in one video every other month for each studio. Her last original work with S1 was released in January 2008, but she continued to make films with Premium until her retirement. Both S1 and Premium are affiliated with Japan's largest producer of adult videos, the [[Hokuto Corporation]].

Honoka's AV career has been quite conservative, she has worked for studios which specialize in softer, more glamour-oriented types of pornography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/D_BANK/2006MAY/selldebut.html|title=Sell Debut - Deep Impact|accessdate=2008-10-13|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/ JSexNetwork]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=26
|title=JAV News - Things to Know about S1 Studio |month=August|year=2008|accessdate=2008-09-24|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she has never ventured into the more extreme genres of Japanese porn. She is a very popular actress in Japan and in the DMM list of the top 100 actresses by sales, she placed #2 in 2006 and #3 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/ranking/=/mode=year/aetas=2006/article=actress/rank=1_20

Honoka was part of the S1 compilation video ''Hyper – Barely There Mosaic'' (ハイパーギリギリモザイク) with AV idols [[Sora Aoi]], [[Yua Aida]], [[Yuma Asami]], [[Maria Ozawa]] and [[Rin Aoki]] which won the 2006 [[AV Open]] competition among Japanese porn studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/japans-av-open-contest-2008/|title=Japan’s AV Open contest 2008|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|month=June|year=2008}} The original source http://www.av-open.com/ranking/index.html is closed.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the recipient of the &quot;Best Actress&quot; prize at the 2007 [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] for the 2006 broadcast year. After pressing her tongue against the phallus-shaped prize statuette, she declared &quot;I never thought I would be selected. I'd like to say that it was 'my pleasure' to my fans.&quot; In closing, she added &quot;I want to be more famous in the AV field&quot; and &quot;I also want to encourage other girls to strive to be the best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bigempire.com/sake/honoka_adult.html|title=Honoka Takes Top Prize at Adult Broadcasting Awards |accessdate=2008-10-14|publisher=[http://www.bigempire.com/ www.bigempire.com]|month=March|year=2007}} Reprinted June 8, 2008 in [http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2008/06/18/honoka-takes-top-prize-at-adult-broadcasting-awards/#more-119 Tokyo Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; Honoka was again honored by fans by winning the Best Actress award in the 2006 [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#AV Actress Grand Prix 2006|AV Actress Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianidols.net/news.php?day.20070107|title=AV Grand Prix 2006 Winners Announced|accessdate=2008-11-17|publisher=[http://www.asianidols.net/ Asianidols.net]|date=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of her S1 videos, ''Hyper Risky Mosaic - Special Bath House Tsubaki'' (ハイパーギリギリモザイク 特殊浴場 TSUBAKI 貸切入浴料1億円), with 11 other S1 actresses was the First Place winning entry in the 2007 [[AV Open]] contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/avopen/avopen02_result.html|title=2nd AV Open Results|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|accessdate=2008-10-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honoka announced in her Official Blog that she was retiring in December 2008 and that her December 7, 2008 video for Premium, ''Pleasures of Education'', would be her last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://honoka620.exblog.jp/m2008-12-01/|title=Honoka Blog 2008年 12月|publisher=[http://honoka620.exblog.jp/ honoka620.exblog.jp]|accessdate=2009-02-15|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;javstars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://javstars.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/honoka-announces-retirement/|title=Honoka Announces Retirement!|publisher=[http://javstars.wordpress.com/ JAV Stars]|accessdate=2009-02-16|date=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in one final event for Premium by making a round of publicity appearances at Tokyo shops on December 20, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;javstars&quot;/&gt; She also acted as co-host with mainstream actor Nagare Hagiwara for the 2009 [[AV Grand Prix]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-gp.com/news/avgp_result/bottom.html|title=AVGP 2009 Result announcement|publisher=[http://www.av-gp.com/ www.av-gp.com]|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has continued to keep her blog open.

{{nihongo|'''Kei Mizutani'''|水谷 ケイ|Mizutani Kei}} (born May 7, 1974) is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[adult film]] actress. She has appeared in multiple photo books, movies, and TV series in Japan and her DVD sets are popular in Japan, the United States, and Europe. 
==Career==
Mizutani was born in [[Aomori Prefecture]] where she was also raised. She began her modelling career as a swimsuit and nude model for magazines, and began making TV appearances. She became a regular on the late-night adult-oriented TV program variety, ''[[Gilgamesh Night]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdvisionjapan.com/kei.html|title=Kei Mizutani Interview (English)|date=|accessdate=2007-02-17 |format= |work=www.dvdvisionjapan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===''Weather Woman''===
Mizutani's first movie, ''Weather Woman'' was one of the most surprising successes in Japanese cinema of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser. (1998). ''Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films''. Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications. Miami. (ISBN 1-88928-852-7), p.492.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a popular adult manga which had been made into an anime series, ''[[Weather Report Girl]]'', the movie tells the story of a woman who becomes a phenomenally successful TV weatherwoman by exposing her panties on the air. Bandai Home Video financed the film, but, considering it a minor production, released it directly to video in 1995. The video quickly developed a large cult following. 

Bandai, mistakenly attributing the video's success to its sexual content, produced a sequel which emphasized the sex and concentrated less on the storyline and dark humor of the original. After reading the script, Mizutani refused to appear in the sequel, which proved to be a failure. However the reputation of the original video continued to grow. It won both the [[Oslo Films from the South Festival|Oslo Film Festival]] and the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]] in 1996. Bandai responded by pulling the original video from the market and releasing the film theatrically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-493&quot;&gt;Weisser, p.493.&lt;/ref&gt;

After its [[August 16]], [[1996]] theatrical debut, ''Weather Woman'' became one of the most successful releases of the year in Japan. Besides its popularity with audiences, the critics also praised the film, and several put it on their top 10 lists for 1996. Kinema Jumpo named the film #26 for the year. In 1997, a television series based on the movie was produced for Asahi TV Network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisser-493&quot;/&gt;

=== After ''Weather Woman'' ===
Following in the rise of her ''Weather Woman'' popularity, Mizutani recorded a CD single in 1996 entitled ''He Loves Me'' ([http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000064DRJ ヒー・ラヴズ・ミー]).&lt;ref name = &quot;Interview&quot;/&gt; In 1998, she played the role of Shelinda, a villain on the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' show ''[[Seijuu Sentai Gingaman]]'', which was adapted in [[North America]] as ''[[Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt; In July 2000, she was a guest at the San Diego Comic Con, where the English version of ''Weather Woman'' received its premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keimizutani.com/KeiSanDiego.cfm|title=My Trip to San Diego|date=2002|accessdate=2007-02-17 |format= |work=[http://www.keimizutani.com/ Kei Mizutani Official Website]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Meisa Hanai'''|花井メイサ|Hanai Meisa}}  is a  [[Japan]]ese [[AV idol]] famous for her exotic looks and her natural H-cup bust.

==Life and career==
Hanai was born on July 20, 1986 in Japan. Like only a few other Japanese AV actresses, among them [[Maria Ozawa]], [[Tina Yuzuki]] and [[Anna Ohura]], she is of mixed heritage. Her father is Japanese and her mother is Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/index.php/mixed-blood-half-caucasian-japanese-av-stars/|title=Mixed Blood: Half-Caucasian Japanese Adult Video Stars|date=August 28, 2008|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her AV debut in November 2007 with [[S1 No. 1 Style]], a major Japanese AV studio associated with the [[Hokuto Corporation]] group of companies, and known for dealing only with popular actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.s1s1s1.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=23502/|title=Meisa Hanai Profile &amp; Filmography|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=[http://www.s1s1s1.com/ www.s1s1s1.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superjav.com/blog/?p=26
|title=JAV News - Things to Know about S1 Studio |month=August|year=2008|accessdate=2008-10-28|publisher=[http://www.superjav.com/ JAV News]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued making one movie per month for S1 through the end of 2008. Despite being a newcomer to the AV industry, she broke into the DMM list of the Top 100 Actresses by sales from their website for the last half of 2007, ranked at #8,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/ranking/=/term=last_2007/mode=actress/|title=DMM 2007年 上半期 DVD AV女優 ランキング ベスト100 (Top 100 actresses last half 2007)|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; amd for the first half of 2008, ranking at #23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/ranking/=/term=first_2008/mode=actress/rank=21_40|title=DMM 2008年 上半期 DVD AV女優 ランキング ベスト100 (Top 100 actresses first half 2008)|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanai also did a &quot;gravure&quot; (non-sex) shoot for Vol. 178 of ''Bejean'' magazine, published in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jlist.com/PRODUCT/MMG127|title=Bejean Aug 2008 vol. 178|accessdate=2009-01-20|publisher=[http://www.jlist.com/ JList]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She debuted with Kawaii, another Hokuto company specializing in glamour videos, in the appropriately titled ''Kawaii Debut'' in January 2009. She also began appearing in a series of videos for [[Moodyz]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moodyz.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=23502/|title=花井メイサ(はないめいさ)|accessdate=2009-07-10|publisher=[http://www.moodyz.com/ www.moodyz.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, she has been on GyaO TV's show ''Ero Para'' (エロ生☆パラダイス).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/meisa-hanai-appears-on-bejean-and-kawaii/|title=Meisa Hanai appears on Bejean and Kawaii|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ Japan Sugoi]|date=May 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She used to do a lot of live action work when she was a teen under the name '''Ayumi Nagashii''' (永椎 あゆみ ''Nagashii Ayumi'').  She later became an idol under the name '''Kanori Kadomatsu''' (角松 かのり ''Kadomatsu Kanori''), appearing in men's magazines and [[V-Cinema]]. Several of the films were very explicit in violence, sex and nudity.  Trying to break out of the [[horror film|horror]]/[[exploitation film|exploitation]] genre and back into legitimate cinema, she briefly changed her name back to '''Ayumi Nagashii''' (永椎 あゆ美 ''Nagashii Ayumi'') and began working on the occasional anime as a voice actress.  On November 1, 1998 she changed her name to Ryōka Yuzuki and currently focuses mainly on voice work.

{{nihongo|'''Nao Oikawa'''|及川奈央|Oikawa Nao}} is a former Japanese [[adult video]] actress who won an Award for Excellence, Best Actress category at the 2005 [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]]. Since retiring from the adult entertainment field, Oikawa has become a popular TV personality and singer.

==Life and career==
Nao Oikawa was born in [[Hiroshima Prefecture]], [[Japan]] on April 21, 1981. In an interview from early 2002 she says that she had already done most of the things she performs in her adult videos with her high school boyfriend, including [[anal sex]], [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]], and public sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmate.com/interviews/article_57.html|title=Best Video: Group Interview|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://www.jmate.com/ Jmate]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But she says she had never used a [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] before her AV work, and at least in early 2001, her lovers in private life were only a few (less than double digits).&lt;ref name=&quot;bv&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b-v.co.jp/back-number/171/oikawanao.html|title=及川奈緒の部屋へようこそ|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://www.b-v.co.jp/ www.b-v.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV debut===
Oikawa made her adult video debut at age nineteen for the Media Station Cosmos label in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2000.htm|title=ＡＶ年表 2000|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/ homepage3.nifty.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second movie, ''Indecent Woods'', in documentary form, has her and the director getting her boyfriend's approval for her AV work.&lt;ref name=&quot;bv&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=it59|title=Indecent Woods|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her third video, ''Sister-in-Law is Beautiful Nurse'', Oikawa is a divorced woman who returns to work as a nurse and has sex not only with a doctor but also her ex-brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kr9139|title=Sister in law is beautiful nurse|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next video, ''Uniform Doll'', is [[cosplay]] with Oikawa dressed as a schoolgirl, bus conductor, waitress, and in a [[yukata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=ka2010|title=Sex Doll In Different Uniforms|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her first year of adult work, she made only a few more videos, includung a softcore [[V-Cinema]] movie, ''Virgin Teacher Hinako'' in September 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2001/ov129120.htm|title=処女教師　日菜子|accessdate=2008-11-12|publisher=[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/ JMdB]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; but her career took off in late 2001 and 2002 when she made a number of videos with both large mainstream companies such as [[Alice Japan]]  and smaller independent producers (Momotaro). In her December 2001 video for Alice Japan, ''Inhumanity Nao Oikawa'', 10 amateur men come to the video studio and do their best at being porn actors by having sex with Oikawa, using a quiz game to decide the sex position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kr9160|title=Inhumanity|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her video ''Fallen Angel X'' (February 2002) features a 12-man orgy scene, anal sex, and vaginal insertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=bz86|title=The Fallen Angel X|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KMP and later career===
In May 2002, Oikawa began an association with the the new KMP Million label which continued until her retirement. Although she continued to work for other video producers, the majority of her films were with KMP, most of them under the direction of Goro Tameike. Her first video with KMP and Tameike, ''Another Side of Nao Oikawa'', involved anal sex and forced [[fellatio]]. One of her male partners is famed porn actor [[Taka Kato]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=milv005|title=REVERSE / Nao Oikawa
|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/digital/videoa/-/detail/=/cid=84milv005/|title=裏 及川奈央
|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second volume of the same series, ''Another Side of Nao Oikawa 2'', was even more hardcore with lesbian [[strap-on dildo|strap-on]] sex, forced fellatio and vomiting, multiple partner fellatio and vibrator play. Once again [[Taka Kato]] takes part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=rmild086|title=Another Side of Nao Oikawa 2
|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also made a [[bukkake]] and [[gokkun]] video for [[Soft On Demand]] (SOD) in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://megaasians.net/updates/preview/sddm200.htm|title=SDDM-200 A veteran of the adult industry in Japan gets splattered.

On a gentler note, Oikawa appeared with [[Kurumi Morishita]] in a June 2003 production by KMP entitled ''Forest in Nude''. Directed by [[TOHJIRO]], this lesbian genre video is a &quot;soft, bittersweet story of two friends who remember the days of their youth and the sexual experiences they had&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lezlovevideo.com/product_details/default.asp?cat=jav&amp;scat=1173&amp;mscssid=76D979A916864E4DB87D2DE8904E5808&amp;ProductGroupID=9A4450B86C8C46E291C2566447A71F62|title=Forest In Nude 
|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=[http://www.lezlovevideo.com/ LezLoveVideo]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in two JAV cosplay videos for JoyDel: ''Teacher Nao'' (December 2003),&lt;ref name=&quot;Teacher Nao&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xonair.com/detail.cfm?id=10028138&amp;lang=US|title=JDA Series: Teacher Nao (Joydel) (Nao Oikawa) (jda001)|accessdate=2009-01-24|publisher=[http://www.xonair.com/home.cfm?lang=US X On Air]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nurse Nao'' (January 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nurse Nao&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xonair.com/detail.cfm?id=10031175|title=JDA Series: Nurse Nao (Joydel) (Nao Oikawa) (jda003)|accessdate=2009-01-24|publisher=[http://www.xonair.com/home.cfm?lang=US X On Air]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two videos are notable for lacking the mosaic censoring typical of most JAV releases. Oikawa's final video, for KMP, was ''The Woman Called Nao'', released June 2004, with the actress nao, but there have since been numerous re-issues and compilations of her earlier videos. 

===Popularity and recognition===
At her peak, Oikawa was one of the most popular and well-known [[AV Idol|AV Idols]] in Japan. In 2003 (the earliest date available) she was #1 in the DMM list of the 100 top-ranked actresses by sales on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/ranking/=/mode=year/aetas=2003/article=actress/rank=1_20

Oikawa has been honored for her AV performances several times. She was runner-up to [[Ryōko Mitake]] in fan voting for the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2002 X City Grand Prix Awards|2002 AV Grand Prix]] Best Actress Award from X City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/CITY_ORG/grandprix2002/PRIZE/result.html|title=A.V.G.P. Adult Video Grand Prix 2002
|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2005 [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] for satellite TV broadcasts in 2004, Oikawa's video ''Fan Appreciation Hot Springs Bus Tour'' won the Grand Prize for Original Programming and she also gained an Award for Excellence in the Best Actress category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/nlbn/NL000500/vl_16.htm|title=2004年度ＣＳアダルト番組アワード開催 (CS 2004 year Adult Awards Show)|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ AllAbout]|date=February 28, 2005|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|accessdate=2008-10-27|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Oikawa has said that she did not always find working in the AV industry to be pleasant. In one early video shot outdoors, she reported that she was &quot;abused on camera both physically and mentally, with the men at the sides enjoying that. Getting hurt mentally is really hard. Much worse than any physical pain. Especially when you see the director getting off on it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate&quot;/&gt; Although many AV stars are ostracized by their families, in a 2005 article in the magazine ''Tokusatsu Shinsengumi'', Oikawa credits her mother with giving her the help she needed: &quot;Without the support from my mother, I never would have made it as an adult video performer&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/archive/news/2005/12/20051214p2g00m0dm012000c.html|title=Turning tricks helps keep desperate families together

===TV appearances===
Like AV Idols [[Nana Natsume]] and [[Sora Aoi]], Oikawa has been able to use her fame in the AV industry to enter mainstream media work. Soon after her retirement from adult videos, she acted in and directed an episode of the Japanese TV horror series ''Fantazuma: Cursed House'' or ''Fantazuma: Noroi no yakata'' (ファンタズマ〜呪いの館〜) which aired on [[TV Tokyo]] in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fjmovie.com/horror/t12/25.html|title=Fantazuma: Noroi no yakata (TV series)
|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=[http://www.fjmovie.com/horror/ Japanese Horror Movie Database]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also played a role in the 2004 comedy-horror TV series {{nihongo|''[[The Great Horror Family]]''|怪奇大家族|Kaiki daikazoku}} directed by [[Takashi Shimizu]] on [[TV Tokyo]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fjmovie.com/horror/t11/20.html|title=Kaiki daikazoku (TV Series)
|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=[http://www.fjmovie.com/horror/ Japanese Horror Movie Database]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in Episode 7 of ''Hell Girl'' or ''Jigoku shoujo'' (地獄少女) on [[Nihon TV]] in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fjmovie.com/horror/t11/71.html|title=Jigoku shoujo (2006) (TV series)
|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=[http://www.fjmovie.com/horror/ Japanese Horror Movie Database]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[TV Asahi]] after midnight massage-parlor drama ''Kaikan Shokunin'' (快感職人), Oikawa joined regular cast member [[Sora Aoi]] when she guest-starred as the cabaret club girl in Episode 1 (July 8, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/kaikan/story01.html|title=Episode 1|accessdate=2009-01-24|publisher=[http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/ Japanese www.tv-asahi.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9th, 2007 she made a guest appearance in the 6th episode of Tsuburaya Productions mini-series {{nihongo|''[[Ultraseven X]]''|ＵＬＴＲＡＳＥＶＥＮ Ｘ（ウルトラセブン エックス）|Urutorasebun Ekkusu}} playing a bartender named &quot;Alisa&quot;.

Oikawa was cast as Negi's advisor &quot;Shizuna Minamoto&quot; in the 2007-08 late-night [[TV Tokyo]] series ''[[Negima!: Magister Negi Magi]]'' (魔法先生ネギま！) based on the [[manga]] of the same name about a young male wizard from Wales (Negi, played by a 13-year old girl) and his 31 female students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starchild.co.jp/special/negima-drama/|title=Magister Negi Magi

|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ AnimeNewsNetwork]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, she played the role of villainess &quot;Kegalesia&quot; in the [[TV Asahi]] [[tokusatsu]] TV series ''[[Engine Sentai Go-onger]]'' (炎神戦隊ゴーオンジャー) which ran until February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tokusatsu.de/s/4/engine-sentai-go-onger/|title=炎神戦隊ゴーオンジャー - Engine Sentai Go-onger
|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=[http://en.tokusatsu.de/ Tokusatsu]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the September 21, 2008 episode, Oikawa and her co-stars [[Rina Aizawa]] and [[Yumi Sugimoto]] teamed up as the one-off G3 Princess singing group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaijinheart.blog100.fc2.com/blog-entry-197.html|title=Ex-Porn Actress Oikawa Nao finally becomes an idol 
|accessdate=2008-11-14|publisher=[http://gaijinheart.blog100.fc2.com/ gaijinheart.blog100.fc2.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Her hobbies are [[Tarot]] divination and [[East Asian calligraphy|calligraphy]] and she enjoys all types of Japanese food, especially with a glass of [[sake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oikawanao.jp/profile.html| title=Oikawa Nao Profile|accessdate=2008-11-15|publisher=[http://www.oikawanao.jp/ Official Web Site]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for her sex life, she said in a 2002 interview &quot;I want something normal. I don't want any weird sex ... We do weird things for work anyway.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jmate&quot;/&gt;

Oikawa first met Japanese comedian Tomonori Jinnai (阵内智则) sometime in 2003 when he was an unknown. Their relationship continued after his success - Jinnai invited her to be a guest on his radio program “Jinnai Tomonori No Hitoribancho&quot; in October 2005 and they even joined a celebrity curry connosieur's club together. Their relationship soured when Jinnai began dating actress [[Norika Fujiwara]] in the summer of 2006 and in November of the same year, Jinnai and Fujiwara announced their engagement. Oikawa was reportedly very upset over the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/shukan/376|title=Former porn star Oikawa still has thing for Jinnai

{{nihongo|'''Ai Iijima'''|飯島 愛|Iijima Ai}} (October 31, 1972 &amp;ndash; December 24, 2008) was a [[Japanese person|Japanese]] [[mass media|media]] personality and [[AV idol]]. She belonged to the entertainment agency [[Watanabe Entertainment]] until her retirement. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nt2099.com/J-ENT/news/asian-entertainment/japanese-entertainment-news/japan-a-possible-return-for-iijima-ai-when-health-is-better/ A possible return for Iijima Ai when health is better?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Born as {{nihongo|Matsue Okubo|大久保松恵|Ōkubo Matsue}}&lt;ref name=&quot;sankei&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} {{cite web|url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/affairs/crime/081224/crm0812241711020-n1.htm|title=元タレントの飯島愛さんが死亡 (Former television personality Ai Iijima has died)|publisher=Sankei Shimbun|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, she described a troubled early life in her autobiography. She was raped in her early teens, and had an abortion,&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/modern/iijima_ai.shtml|title=TV Stars - Ai Iijima|accessdate=2007-03-15|publisher=[http://www.japan-zone.com/index.shtml Japan-Zone]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She ran away from home as a teenager, later stating, &quot;I hated my parents, to the point where I would rather be coached by bums to sleep in parks wrapped in newspaper blankets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Niederberger&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Carlo|last=Niederberger|title=From porn to pop culture|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/newsmaker/207|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061207010143/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/newsmaker/207|publisher=[[Japan Today]]|date=November 18, 2004|archivedate=2006-12-07|accessdate=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make a living during this time, Iijima worked in [[karaoke]] establishments, snack bars, [[Ginza]] [[hostess club]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Niederberger&quot;/&gt; and in ''[[enjo kōsai]]'' (paid dating).&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;/&gt; She entered the entertainment business in her late teens, appearing on late night television programs wearing clothing such as [[thong (underwear)|thongs]], [[miniskirt|short skirts]], and even appearing [[topless]] with saline breast implants. Her stage name was chosen by a fan survey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Early career===
Iijima's [[Pornographic film|adult video]] debut was in April 1992 for the [[Crystal-Eizou]] AV company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_1992.htm|title=1992|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She quickly became the top AV actress of the time, appearing in over 100 films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;/&gt; She became a hostess on the nighttime television program, ''[[Gilgamesh Night]]'', where she became known as the &quot;T-Back Queen&quot;, for her practice of turning her rear to the camera, lifting her skirt and flashing her [[G-string]], known in Japan as a &quot;T-Back&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryann|last=Connell|title=From AV to TV, Ai Iijima faces the final curtain after doing it 'her way'|url=http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/face/news/20070309p2g00m0dm022000c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312053630/http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/waiwai/face/news/20070309p2g00m0dm022000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=March 9, 2007|archivedate=2007-03-12|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the top AV models by the age of 20, with admitted breast implants, a nose job, eyebrow work and bottom work as well, she decided to leave the [[Pornography in Japan|porn business]], intent on a career in mainstream entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;/&gt;

After ending her career in adult videos, Iijima released a musical single in 1993 and soon became a regular on daytime TV talk shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt; Before long, she became one of the most successful [[tarento]] to make the transition from pornography into mainstream entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Emiko (translator)|last=Ichikawa|title=Daughters of 'respectable' families flaunt all in porn videos|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/shukan/214|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312161808/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/shukan/214|date=[[February 8]], 2004|archivedate=2007-03-12|accessdate=2007-10-04|publisher=&quot;Shukan Post Watcher&quot; at [[Japan Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She even provided the story for her own [[manga]] series, ''[[Time Traveler Ai]]'', in which she was featured as the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2827|title=Time Traveler Ai (manga)|accessdate=2007-03-15|publisher=[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ Anime News Network]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicly, Iijima became known for her outspokenness and ability to speak frankly about her past and her personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;/&gt; Privately, a friend says, &quot;At first glance, Ai looks like the really rough around the edges, but she's actually really sensitive, and she always thinks of others in ways like giving them little presents. She's that type...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt;

===''Platonic Sex''===
In 2000 Iijima published ''[[Platonic Sex]]'', a semi-autobiographical novel about a young girl who leaves home to escape her parents and ends up as an adult movie star. The book was a best-seller, selling over 1.7 million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt; By 2004, the book had been translated into [[Korean language|Korean]], Chinese, Spanish and [[Italian language|Italian]], and an [[English language|English]] version was being planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Niederberger&quot;/&gt; She visited Taiwan in 2001 and was well-received by the media there. The novel was also made into a four-hour television series&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;/&gt; and a theatrical movie which Iijima supervised.&lt;ref&gt;Credited as {{nihongo|supervisor|監修}} and {{nihongo|author|原作}} at {{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0328410.htm|title={{nihongo2|飯島 愛}} - Iijima Ai|accessdate=2007-03-13|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iijima's [[catch phrase]], &quot;watashi teki ni&quot; (&quot;my way&quot;), became a popular [[catch-phrase]] due to the popularity of the book and film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:Iijima-ai.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Ai Iijima as a mainstream TV celebrity]]
By 2002, Iijima had become a regular on several TV shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt; With her pornographic past a decade away, Iijima was so well-known as a mainstream TV celebrity that many younger members of her audience were unaware that she had once been one of the top AV actresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;/&gt; Items from her early career began going for high prices, and an unauthorized 2002 box-set release of her pornographic appearances sold very well, until her lawyers took it off the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan-zone&quot;/&gt;

Iijima's acceptance into the mainstream gave her access to the highest levels of Japanese society, including once having dinner with [[Junichiro Koizumi]], who was Japan's [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Minister of Health and Welfare]] at the time. Iijima claims that on this occasion, the future [[Prime Minister]] discussed the sex life of [[dragonflies]] with her.&lt;ref name=&quot;japantoday-1509&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Former porn queen, sex book author and TV 'talent' Ai Iijima speaks about her past at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan this week.|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/picture/1509|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070506081455/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/picture/1509|publisher=[[Japan Today]]|date=November 16, 2004|archivedate=2007-05-06|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, Iijima was invited to speak about her past at the [[Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;japantoday-1509&quot;/&gt; Later the same month, she participated in a United Nations program in Tokyo on AIDS awareness in the week leading up to [[World AIDS Day]] on December 1, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iijima-AIDS&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Former porn star Iijima takes part in AIDS awareness event|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/320387|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070307121336/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/320387|publisher=[[Japan Today]]|date=November 29, 2004|archivedate=2007-03-07|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
After the difficulties of her early life, Iijima's career in mainstream entertainment had been remarkably free of trouble for over a decade until she was victimized by an embezzler at her talent agency, who took about 100 million yen from her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt; Late in 2006, she took two weeks off from her position as panelist on the Sunday morning TV variety show, ''Sunday Japon''. She later revealed in her blog that she was suffering from health problems, causing rumors of her possible retirement from show business to circulate in the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt; In March 2007, when asked by the host of ''Sunday Japon'' whether rumors of her retirement were true, Iijima replied, &quot;Yes, I have been wanting to quit for some time. I will announce my future plans next week.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;japantoday-400619&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=TV personality Ai Iijima to quit showbiz world|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/400619|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070506054329/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/400619|publisher=[[Japan Today]]|date=March 25, 2007|archivedate=2007-05-06|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iijima's farewell appearance on the TV program KinSuma, on which she has been a regular for five years, was described as &quot;a teary two-hour sayonara party complete with speeches, bouquets and lots of blubbering&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=William|last=Penn|title=Televiews: Time to limit limitless 'gaman'|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/arts/20070414TDY19002.htm|publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun|Yomiuri Daily]]|date=April 14, 2007|accessdate=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when psychic Fujiko Kimura confronted Iijima on the program, telling her not to retire and suggesting that there was more behind the retirement announcement than had been made public, Iijima &quot;seemed to admit as much and was reduced to tears.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn&quot;/&gt; Whatever the circumstances leading to the decision, Ai Iijima's retirement at the age of 34 brings an end to what has been called &quot;one of the more remarkable careers in the cutthroat Japanese entertainment world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connell&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
{{Refimprovesect|date=December 2008}}
At about 3:30 p.m. on December 24, 2008 (JST), Iijima was found dead in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment not far from Shibuya Crossing.&lt;ref name=&quot;sankei&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;obitjapantoday&quot; &gt;{{cite news |title= Former adult video porno star Ai Iijima found dead at Tokyo apartment |url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/former-porn-star-ai-iijima-found-dead-at-tokyo-apartment|publisher= Japan Today |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was found lying face-down on the floor when medics forced their way into her place. She had been dead for about 7 days, police said. Some of her show business friends told reporters that Ai suffered recently from bouts of melancholia and depression, and they believe her death was accidental or perhaps a heart attack. She once told reporters she was taking medication for a &quot;mild neurosis&quot;. Through this and other occasional entries on her blog, &quot;Porno Hospital&quot;, she kept fans up to date on her life and business dealings. She is said to have been planning to start a new business focused on selling condoms to women. She wrote extensively about a [[World AIDS Day]] event in [[Tochigi Prefecture]] on December 6. On March 3 2007, Sports Nippon reported that Ai Iijima was suffering from hay fever, pyelitis (ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney), cystitis and acute backache. She had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder. Later, in February 2009, police announced that the pathology examination showed she had died of [[pneumonia]], and that there was no suggestion of suicide or murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0204/TKY200902040211.html 飯島愛さん、死因は肺炎　病理検査結果で判明], Asahi Shimbun, February 3&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Runa Akasaka'''|赤坂ルナ|Akasaka Runa|born April 7, 1967}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[actress]] who is best known for her appearances in [[pornographic film|adult video]]s (AV). In the AV field, where an average career spans about a year, with five to ten videos total,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2008-12-29|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|work=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2007-03-20|quote=If she’s only out for money, she will studiously avoid publicity and quit inside a year-the average life-span of an AV girl-with five or ten videos to her credit and an unknowing family bosom to return to.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akasaka's career in AV has lasted nearly four years, with 70 to 90 videos listed for her at two major retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/s/ref=nb_ss_d?__mk_ja_JP=%83J%83%5E%83J%83i&amp;url=search-alias%3Ddvd&amp;field-keywords=%90%D4%8D%E2%83%8B%83i&amp;x=11&amp;y=19|title=DVD › &quot;赤坂ルナ&quot;|accessdate=2008-12-28|publisher=[http://www.amazon.co.jp/ www.amazon.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/list/=/article=actress/id=4251/|title=DMM - Runa Akasaka Filmography|accessdate=2008-12-27|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 2008. Asakusa has also starred in titles in the ''[[pink film]]'' and [[V-Cinema]] genres.

==Career==
Runa Akasaka made her AV debut in 2003, at the age of 36, in the [[Mother I'd like to fuck (MILF)|''jukujo'']] or &quot;Mature woman&quot; genre of Japanese adult entertainment. She worked with a number of different studios for the first few months of her career but at the end of 2003 she joined the major Japanese AV studio [[Moodyz]] where she starred in such Mature-woman AV titles as {{nihongo|''A Friend's Mother''|友人の母|Yuujin no haha}}, and {{nihongo|''The Room Of Two Sexy Madams''|W美熟女の部屋|Double bijukujo no heya}} for noted AV director Goro Tameike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jans-web.com/?p=mcard&amp;id=0705|title=Runa Akasaka - A Friend's Mother|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=[http://jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator 1997-2006]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jans-web.com/?p=mcard&amp;id=0705|title=Runa Akasaka - The Room Of Two Sexy Madams|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=[http://jans-web.com/ Urabon Navigator 1997-2006]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 2004 she began appearing in videos for [[Madonna (studio)|Madonna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madonna-av.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=105/|title=麻生ひかり （あそうひかり|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=[http://www.madonna-av.com/ www.madonna-av.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; an AV studio specializing in the mature woman genre. She made one video a month for Madonna until the end of 2004 when she changed studios again, this time going to KMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.km-produce.com/girls/detail.php?gid=2666|title=赤坂ルナ (Runa Akasaka Profile &amp; Filmography)|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=[http://www.km-produce.com/ www.km-produce.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, Akasaka participated in a unique project for the huge AV conglomerate [[Soft On Demand]] (SOD), playing the mother in a full-length dramatic adult video, ''Nightly Continuous DVD Novel''. The movie, also starring first-time actress Satozakura Hinata, Aoi, and porn legend [[Taka Kato]], was described by SOD as an industry first at a special screening in Tokyo in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sod.co.jp/demand/news/54.html|title=夜の連続DVD小説　おまん|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=[http://www.sod.co.jp/ www.sod.co.jp]|date=July 22, 2005|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually for a mature actress, she appeared in the mainstream men's entertainment magazine ''[[Weekly Playboy]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weekly Playboy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i-dic.dorachan.com/data?aksrn_02|title={{nihongo2|赤坂 ルナ}} |accessdate=2008-12-26|publisher=[http://i-dic.dorachan.com/ 'Web I-dic' (Idol Dictionary)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, AV Research Laboratory-- a non-commercial site specializing in the history of Japanese adult videos-- described Akasaka as a popular &quot;veteran&quot; performer in the mature-woman genre, with three years in the industry and over 40 works to her credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/title/a/akasaka_runa.htm|title=赤坂ルナ (DVD review)|accessdate=2008-12-26|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)|quote=ここまで３年間に４０本以上の作品があるベテラン人気熟女女優だ。]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her AV appearances led to a leading role in the Okura Films/O.P. Films theatrically-released ''[[pink film]]'', {{nihongo|''Pervert Train: Skillful Fingers, Wet Feeling''|痴漢電車　いい指・濡れ気分|Chikan densha: iiyubi*nure kimochi}} (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/2004/eb005220.htm|title={{nihongo2|痴漢電車　いい指・濡れ気分}} |accessdate=2008-12-26|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; an entry in the parent company, [[Shintoho]]'s ''Molester's Train'' train series which [[Academy Award]]-winning director [[Yōjirō Takita]] started in 1982. By 1997 there had been 25 films made in this long-running ''pink film'' series. In their pioneering English-language work on the Japanese erotic cinema, the Weissers write, &quot;Most of the episodes are reminiscent of early American [[nudie-cuties]], especially the voyeuristic titty-flicks like [[Russ Meyer]]'s ''[[Eve and the Handyman]]'' and ''[[The Immoral Mr. Teas|Immoral Mr Teas]]'', or [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]]' ''[[The Adventures of Lucky Pierre|Adventures Of Lucky Pierre]]''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=MOLESTER series including MOLESTER'S TRAIN|last=Weisser|first=Thomas|coauthors=Yuko Mihara Weisser|title=Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films|pages=276-279|year=1998|publisher=Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications|location=Miami|isbn=1-889288-52-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Risa Coda'''|倖田梨紗|Coda Risa}}, also known as '''Risa Koda''' and '''Risa Kouda''' (for softcore appearances), is an award-winning former Japanese model and [[adult video]] (AV) actress.

==Life and career==
===AV debut and career===
Coda made her debut in adult videos in May 2005, at the age of 19, with the prominent AV studio [[h.m.p. (Japan)|h.m.p.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2005.htm|title=2005|accessdate=2009-01-02|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued making adult videos exclusively with h.m.p for almost two years, releasing about one original movie per month. One of her productions from May 2006, ''I Ecstatically Pleasured Myself in Front of My Boyfriend'', uses the documentary format popular in many Japanese adult videos. The plot focuses on her life as an AV actress and contrasts having sex with her boyfriend in private versus sex with an actor in a video scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/info.html?AID=1251|title=I Masturbate Before Boy Till Climax|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/ AV Idol]|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another h.m.p. video, ''She Loves Outdoor Sex!'', released in February 2007, she leaves the studio for some outdoor locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=hrdv00497|title=Outdoor Mania: I'm More Lusty If Watched|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/ AV Idol]|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coda also was part of a controversial venture by h.m.p. to offer adult videos for [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] media, the proprietary disc format used in the [[Sony]] [[Play Station Portable]] (PSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/2005/06/02/news_6126863.html?sid=6126863|title=PSP procures porn in Japan|publisher=[http://au.gamespot.com/ GameSpot.com]|date=June 2, 2005|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She starred in 5 UMD videos released between September 2005 and April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Coda received recognition for her work with h.m.p. from both fans and the AV industry. She was nominated for Best Actress at the 2007 [[Adult Broadcasting Awards]] for appearances on adult satellite TV in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allabout.co.jp/entertainment/adultvideo/closeup/CU20070201A/|title=ＡＶニュースチャンネル２月号 (February AV News Channel)|publisher=[http://allabout.co.jp/ AllAbout]|date=February 1, 2007|last=Otsubo|first=Kemuta|accessdate=2008-10-27|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she won one of the Best Actress Awards for Excellence at the 2006 [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#AV Actress Grand Prix 2006|AV Actress Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianidols.net/news.php?day.20070107|title=AV Grand Prix 2006 Winners Announced|accessdate=2008-11-17|publisher=[http://www.asianidols.net/ Asianidols.net]|date=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her last video for h.m.p. was released in March 2007 and she then signed with one of Japan's largest AV firms, [[Soft On Demand]] (SOD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.sodc.co.jp/actress/02821.php|title=倖田梨紗|publisher=[http://www.sodc.co.jp/ www.sodc.co.jp]|accessdate=2009-01-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made four original videos with SOD including her playing a massage girl in ''Super High-Class Soap Lady'' which contains a lesbian scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=star038|title=Super Hot Massage Girl, Risa Koda|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/ AV Idol]|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Super Fucking, Orgasm Climax, 24 Hours 10 Fucks'' with several group sex scenes including a seven person orgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=star052|title=Fuck and Ecstasy For 24-hour 10 Sex, Risa Koda|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/ AV Idol]|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, she announced her retirement from AV work in her blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/risa_c/|title=Official Blog|publisher=[http://blog.livedoor.jp/ blog.livedoor.jp]|accessdate=2009-01-06|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her retirement video, ''Ultra-Climax Nakadashi Orgasm'', was released for SOD on February 21, 2008.

===Other activities===
Coda tried to launch a career as a [[J-pop]] singer with Sexual Kiss records in late 2006 with a CD single featuring the [[Eurobeat]] song &quot;Paradiso&quot; (パラディソ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ Japan Sugoi]|date=January 5, 2008|accessdate=2009-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used the stage name Lisa and the [[Maxi single|Maxi CD]] released on November 29, 2006 also included two other cuts &quot;Baby.It’s all&quot; and &quot;Eternity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition to her hardcore AV career, Coda also has an extensive list of &quot;gravure&quot; videos where she models partially nude or in a bikini. Her softcore videos were usually made under the name Risa Kouda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A reviewer describes it as &quot;not bad as it features three very attractive women who can’t act and roll with it as best as they can.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Arrest and trial===
In November 2008, Coda and her boyfriend, Japanese tennis pro [[Joji Miyao]], made news for having been arrested for drug possession on October 10. Police found &quot;a small amount of drugs - 0.027 grams of stimulants and about 0.7 grams of marijuana&quot; in Coda's apartment in Tokyo. She said she bought the marijuana to use together with her boyfriend because he enjoyed it. She and Miyao met in May 2007 but only started dating in September when he began spending several nights a week at her apartment. According to her statement, she had started using stimulants in August 2007 after breaking up with a former boyfriend and had been buying small amounts from a local dealer. She said that she bought marijuana for Miyao from the same dealer. She was working at a &quot;high-class cabaret club in [[Roppongi]]&quot; at the time of her arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At her trial in Tokyo District Court in December 2008, Coda, who admitted the charges, was found guilty and sentenced to 18 months, suspended for 3 years. She said her drug use was precipitated by a number of factors: loneliness, her grandfather's death, her mother being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and her breakup with her boyfriend in 2007. She planned to return to her parent's home and might go back to her studies. Her mother, who testified for her at the trial, promised to aid in her recovery. No mention was made of Miyao who had a separate trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A couple of months after her December trial Coda was once again arrested on drug possession charges. At her trial in Tokyo in April 2009, the prosecution asked for two years but the judge imposed a 16 month prison sentence telling her that this was a good time for her to get off drugs. Her fiance testified at the trial as a character witness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikansports 2009-04-23&quot;&gt;{{cite web

{{nihongo|'''Ran Asakawa'''|朝河蘭|Asakawa Ran}} is a famous and extremely prolific [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Model (person)|model]] and [[AV idol]] who made her debut in the adult entertainment field in 2001. In 2003, after making more adult videos than any other AV idol in Japan within one year, she and her agency petitioned the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' for inclusion in their book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jsex profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avstars.jsexnetwork.com/AV_Listing/english/_R/Ran_Asakawa/|title=Ran Asakawa Jsexnetwork Profile|accessdate=2007-08-13|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/ www.jsexnetwork.com]|format=Webpage|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Ran Asakawa was born in [[Kanagawa]] [[Prefecture]], Japan on 4 September 1980. Her first sexual encounter happened when she was 19 and was with a businessman. She says, however, that her first fully pleasurable experience wasn't until about the 10th time.&lt;ref name=&quot;jsex_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/interviews/Ran_Asakawa/|title=Ran Asakawa Jsex Interview |accessdate=2007-08-13|publisher=[http://www.jsexnetwork.com/ www.jsexnetwork.com]|format=Webpage |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asakawa finished high school and began junior college.&lt;ref name=&quot;jsex_interview&quot;/&gt; When she realized that she couldn't make much money doing part time work she decided to start doing adult videos, and later explained, &quot;I wanted to study to get a decent wage but I can't do that while I have a regular 9-5 job, right? So I picked AVs.&quot; She had thought about stripping but decided that the hours were too long.&lt;ref name=&quot;jsex_interview&quot;/&gt; She says she cried after making her first video &quot;wondering what I was doing to myself&quot;. She finally got to like sex on camera but keeps her eyes closed from embarrassment.&lt;ref name=&quot;jsex_interview&quot;/&gt;

At first she was not a popular performer because of her mature looks at a time when very young looking girls were the fashion in porn and she did only about 10 videos in her first six months.&lt;ref name=&quot;jsex_interview&quot;/&gt; However, that changed and Asakawa and her modeling agency submitted an application to the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' for making 212 adult videos within the year of 2002, a number unprecedented in the 20-year history of AV in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tantai.net/nats/ran/guinness.html|title=Guinness Record Application Form|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=[http://tantai.net/ tantai.net]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year (2003), she outdid her previous record by appearing in 304 videos but announced her retirement at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tantai.net/nats/ran/|title=Ran Asakawa|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=[http://tantai.net/ tantai.net]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her total output in Japan including later re-issues and compilations numbers nearly 800 videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s7.artemisweb.jp/tanukitune/asakawa.html|title=朝河蘭 (Ran Asakawa) Videography|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=[http://s7.artemisweb.jp/ s7.artemisweb.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003 the ''[[Taipei Times]]'' reported that Asakawa had come to [[Taiwan]] with the hopes of expanding her career there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Max|last=Woodworth|title=Pop Stop|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2003/09/05/2003066622|publisher=[[Taipei Times]]|date=5 September 2003|accessdate=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Asakawa retired from Japanese AV work, in 2004 she did appear in a number of &quot;uncensored&quot; videos - those without the mosaic pixellation to obscure the genitals found in all standard Japanese adult videos. At least some of the videos were produced in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aventertainments.com/search_Products.aspx?section=0&amp;searchBy=starring&amp;keyword=%E6%9C%9D%E6%B2%B3%E8%98%AD&amp;languageID=2|title=朝河蘭 (Ran Asakawa)|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=[http://www.aventertainments.com/ AV Entertainments]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asakawa is quite a popular performer in Chinese-speaking areas where she is known as Wu Tenglan (武藤兰) and she has an entry under that name in the Chinese language Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9C%9D%E6%B2%B3%E5%85%B0|title=武藤兰 (Ran Muto)|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=[http://zh.wikipedia.org/ zh.wikipedia.org]|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, rumors began circulating on Chinese websites that Asakawa had died in June 2006 of either cancer or renal failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtime.com/group/AVshow/discussion/244328/|title=AV女优档案]回忆武藤兰 (AV Actress Archives - Memories of Ran Muto)|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=[http://www.mtime.com/ MTime]|language=Chinese}} One entry ran: &quot;2006年6月武藤兰病逝&quot; (Ran Muto died June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The rumors were quickly answered by Asakawa's agent on her official website assuring Chinese fans that she was alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wretch.cc/blog/mocear/6546063|title=朝河蘭的訃聞－－造口業比「ＳＹ」更多的「偽」道人士 (Ran Asakawa's False Obituary)|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=[http://www.wretch.cc/ www.wretch.cc]|date=July 13, 2006|language=Chinese}} The response was given in English as: &quot;We don't understand Chinese. Though we would like to make corrections, we don't know hot to write in Chinese. But she is alive and well.Please be relieved,everybody, all fan in China.Thank you.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Milk Ichigo'''|苺みるく|Ichigo Milk}}, also often billed as '''Miruku Ichigo''', is an award-winning Japanese [[adult video]] (AV) actress who has had an exceptionally long career.

==Life and career==
Milk Ichigo was born in Hokkaido on February 2, 1981. Her name, which literally translates as &quot;strawberry milk&quot;, is also the name of a Japanese dessert and candy. Ichigo says she was eating ice cream while trying to think up a stage name and decided &quot;Ichigo Miruku&quot; sounded good.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmateinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmate.com/mt/2005/03/ichigo_miruku.html|title=Milk Ichigo Interview|publisher=[http://www.jmate.com/ JMate]|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first sexual experience was at age 16 with her boyfriend who was 3 years older. In an interview in late 2001, she said she had slept with about ten men but hadn't had sex for two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmateinterview&quot;/&gt;

===AV debut and early career===
She got started in the field when she met an agent while she was working at a cabaret club.&lt;ref name=&quot;xcityinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/CITY_ORG/grandprix2001/interview/interview.html|title=Interview Miruku Ichigo|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ XCity]|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She at first refused the offer but then decided to &quot;give it a shot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmateinterview&quot;/&gt; She began with magazine work and then went into videos. Ichigo's first video, ''I Love You Ichigo Milk'', was released December 25, 2000 for the [[Kuki Inc.|Kuki Tank]] label. She says she was nervous at her debut and had to take &quot;lots of breaks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;xcityinterview&quot;/&gt; The actors and director were angry with her and she was thinking of giving up and going home. She remembers that first director as being a &quot;really weird man by the name Happy Yamada&quot;, a very unique person.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmateinterview&quot;/&gt; She would go on to work with Yamada in numerous videos over the next two years.

Many of her video titles for Kuki played on her name with various combinations including the word &quot;strawberry&quot;. ''Strawberry Club'' from March 2001 is nurse uniform [[cosplay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kt504|title=Strawberry Club|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the April 2001 release ''Strawberry Sherbert'' has her dressed in a diaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=kt509|title=Strawberry Sherbert|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 6th video ''Wet Strawberry'' takes place at a hot spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kt515|title=Wet Strawberry|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichigo said she ended up a bit dizzy from spending too much time in the water during the shoot.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmateinterview&quot;/&gt; Her July 2001 video ''A Summer Strawberry'' took her to a summer resort in Okinawa to have sex on the beach and at the hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kt524|title=A Summer Strawberry|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Strawberry Gathering'' (November 2001) uses the documentary format common in Japanese porn to reveal Ichigo's secret past including sex with a middle-aged man and some mild bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kt546|title=Strawberry Gathering|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another documentary style video, ''A Snow Strawberry'', she returns home to Hokkaido to visit her ex-boyfriend but ends up having a one-night stand with a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kt552|title=Snow Strawberry|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another video, ''Strawberry Call'', gives Ichigo the chance to play three different sisters, a tough one, a bright one, and a cute school girl. The three fight off the kidnappers of one of the customers of their coffee shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kt556|title=Here Is Milk Ichigo|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichigo was recognized by fans for her work in 2001 by being given the Best Actress Award at the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2001 X City Grand Prix Awards|X City Grand Prix Awards]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/CITY_ORG/grandprix2001/PRIZE/result.html|title=Adult Video Grandprix 2001|accessdate=2008-11-16|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ X City]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her last video for Kuki, issued in April 2002 and entitled simply ''Goodbye'', has her as a teacher having sex with her students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=kt572|title=Goodbye|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While with the Kuki Tank label, Ichigo had also been making videos with Max-A Samansa and [[Alice Japan]], both part of the large [[Kuki Inc.|Kuki]] associated group of AV companies. In one of them, ''Splash'', she plays a mermaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=xs2242|title=Splash|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AVIdol]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichigo has said that the cover from this video box is her favorite.&lt;ref name=&quot;xcityinterview&quot;/&gt;

===Later career===
In late 2002, Ichigo switched studios, going from the Kuki group to [[Moodyz]], one of the constituent companies in the [[Hokuto Corporation]]. Her first two videos for Moodyz were with her first director, Happy Yamada. Ichigo continued with Moodyz for almost a year and then essentially stopped making original videos for mainstream Japanese porn.

Beginning in late 2003, Ichigo began making a number of &quot;uncensored&quot; videos. These uncensored videos lack the mosaic pixelation which is used to obscure the genitals in standard Japanese AV. These videos are only marketed internationally outside of Japan or in underground ([[urabon]]) venues in Japan. Among these videos was ''Japanese Superidols Gold Vol. 19''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanx.com/detail.cfm?ID=10032507|title=JapanX Milk Ichigo|publisher=[http://www.japanx.com/ JapanX.com]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; from March 2004 and the September 2005 super-heroine cosplay adventure ''Akiba-Troops! Cutie Rangers!'' co-starring [[Sakura Sakurada]] and Tsumiki Shindo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aventertainments.com/product_lists.aspx?product_id=11989&amp;languageID=1|title=Akiba-Troops! Cutie Rangers! |publisher=[http://www.aventertainments.com/ AV Entertainments]|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Suicide attempt===
In July 2005, Japanese news sources reported that Ichigo had attempted suicide in her Tokyo apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://japanese-adult-movie.blogspot.com/2005/08/japanese-adult-movie-idol-ichigo.html|title=Japanese adult movie idol - Ichigo Miruku |publisher=[http://japanese-adult-movie.blogspot.com/ Japanese Adult Movie]|Date=August 4, 2005|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the sources, on July 13, 2005, she tried to commit suicide by taking 20 sleeping pills and then slashing her wrists. A suicide note said it was due to [[Shintaro Yoshitake]] ([[:ja:吉武真太郎|吉武 真太郎]]). Yoshitake was a relief pitcher for the [[Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks]] baseball team with whom Ichigo was having an affair. Ichigo had only known Yoshitake (who was married) for a short time but had developed a deep attachment for him and became despondent when he broke off their relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvmania&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvmania.livedoor.biz/archives/28419583.html |title=AV女優苺みるく自殺未遂！「私を弄んだソフトバンク吉武投手を許さない！」|publisher=[http://tvmania.livedoor.biz/ tvmania.livedoor.biz]|date=July 19, 2005|accessdate=2009-01-28|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichigo was taken to the hospital by police who had been alerted by Ichigo's mother who was worried by her daughter's hints about suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zakzak.co.jp/gei/2005_07/g2005072101.html|title=ＡＶ女優の苺みるく自殺未遂 
|publisher=[http://www.zakzak.co.jp/ Zakzak]|date=July 21, 2005|accessdate=2009-01-28|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ichigo appeared soon afterwards in a magazine photo showing her scarred wrist.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvmania&quot;/&gt; As an aside, in an interview years before, Ichigo had declared jokingly that she didn't expect to live past 24&lt;ref name=&quot;xcityinterview&quot;/&gt; - her age at the time of her suicide attempt.

===Retirements and comebacks===
From late 2005, Ichigo was seen only infrequently in the adult video industry. She made two videos for the newly formed [[CROSS studio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crosscross.jp/works/-/list/=/article=actress/id=997/|title=苺みるく 出演作品一覧|publisher=[http://www.crosscross.jp/ www.crosscross.jp]|accessdate=2009-01-29|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then returned in November 2006 to make two [[Sadomasochism|S&amp;M]] [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] movies with [[Attackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attackers.net/actress/-/detail/=/id=997/|title=苺みるく ( いちごみるく ) - Milk Ichigo Profile &amp; Filmography
|publisher=[http://www.attackers.net/ www.attackers.net]|accessdate=2009-01-28|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, almost two years passed before she made her next video, ''Comeback'',  with Moodyz in December 2008. She has continued to release new titles in 2009.

|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she made her debut as an adult video (AV) actress in the April 2005 [[Kuki Inc.|Kuki]] Tank release ''In Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2005.htm|title=2005年 （平成17年）|accessdate=2009-04-08|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued working for Kuki through 2005, most often with director Harry Sugino, before moving on to other studios.

Asami also appeared in several [[V-Cinema]] releases and theatrical films including starring in the February 2006 film {{nihongo|''Sukeban Boy'' or ''[[Oira Sukeban]]''|おいら女蛮 スケバン|Oira sukeban}} where she played a boy with a girl's face who decides to join a girl's school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1080767/|title=Oira sukeban (2006) |publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMdB]|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=323719|title=おいら女蛮（スケバン）(2006)|publisher=[http://www.allcinema.net/ AllCinema]|accessdate=2009-07-20|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer commented that she is &quot;a woman playing a boy playing a girl. Which isn’t easy to pull off.  However, she actually does a thoroughly decent job of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmjournal.net/mjocallaghan/2007/04/28/sukeban-boy-2006/|title=Sukeban Boy (2006)|publisher=[http://filmjournal.net/ filmjournal.net]|accessdate=2009-07-20|date=April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 she also had a lead role playing the title heroine's sidekick Miki in [[Noboru Iguchi]]'s gore-fest {{nihongo|''[[The Machine Girl]]''|片腕マシンガール|Kataude mashin gâru}} which premiered at the [[Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival]] in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1050160/|title=IMDb - Kataude mashin gâru (2008)|accessdate=2008-10-14|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=330189|title=片腕マシンガール The Machine Girl|publisher=[http://www.allcinema.net/ AllCinema]|accessdate=2009-07-21|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reprised her role (billed as Asami Sugiura) in the January 2009 V-Cinema sequel {{nihongo|''[[Shyness Machine Girl]]''|hajiraiマシンガール|Hajirai mashin gāru}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1319567/|title=The Hajirai Machine Girl (2009) (V)|accessdate=2009-07-21|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spopro.net/machinegirl/news.htm|title=スピンオフ短編『hajiraiマシンガール』詳細|publisher=[http://www.spopro.net/machinegirl/news.htm Machine Girl News]|accessdate=2009-07-21|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between, she also had a part in [[Yūdai Yamaguchi]]'s horror film ''Tamami: The Baby's Curse'' released in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1188674/|title=Akanbo shôjo|accessdate=2009-09-21|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For her performances in such ''[[pink film]]''s as {{nihongo|''Female Prisoner Ayaka: Tormenting and Breaking in a Bitch''|女囚アヤカ　いたぶり牝調教|Joshū Ayaka: itaburi mesu chōkyō}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/data/2008/080910/080919ayaka.htm|title=女囚アヤカ　いたぶり牝調教|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=[http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/menu.htm P*G Website]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyajima won 3rd place in the &quot;Best New Actress&quot; category at the [[Pink Grand Prix]] for the year 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/best10/2008.htm|title=2008年度ベストテン (Best 10 of 2008)|accessdate=April 8, 2009|publisher=[http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/menu.htm P*G Website]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asami's adult video with three other actresses, ''Three Sisters Ninja Sex'', a period costume female ninja ([[kunoichi]]) piece, was the Kasakura entry for the 2009 [[AV Grand Prix]] contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/-/detail/=/cid=66avgp110/|title=三姉妹vs女剣士 くノ一凌辱秘奥義外伝|accessdate=2009-07-21|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ DMM]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, Asami also acted in three other elaborate historical [[cosplay]] AVs for Cosmos Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?id=rmd781k|title=Girl Ninja Hot and Brave Story|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=rmd790k|title=COSPLAY OF MAIDEN AT THE SHRINE|publisher=[http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/ AV Idol Directory]|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=rmd799k|title=OLD ROMANTIC EROTICISM OF SEXY MAID, LEWD LADY AND PURE SCHOOL GIRL

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Sora Aoi was born November 11, 1983 in [[Tokyo]]. As a student she worked at various part-time jobs in the food-service industry, such as pizza parlours, pubs and sushi bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b-v.co.jp/back-number/195/aoisola.html|title=蒼井そらの部屋へようこそ - Video Idol Interview|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=www.b-v.co.jp|language=Japanese|quote=いろいろやってましたよ。居酒屋さんとか、すし屋さんとかピザ屋さんとか……。}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in her third year in high school, Aoi was scouted in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] by a talent agency for [[Gravure idol|gravure]] modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b-v.co.jp/back-number/195/aoisola.html|title=蒼井そらの部屋へようこそ - Video Idol Interview|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=www.b-v.co.jp|language=Japanese|quote=渋谷で友だちと待ち合わせしていたときにスカウトされたんです... 高校３年生でした。}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how her stage name was chosen, Aoi explained, &quot;My agency asked what color I liked. I said blue (&quot;ao&quot; in Japanese). He also asked what I like in general. I said sky (&quot;Sora&quot; in Japanese). So, he chose Sora Aoi (means &quot;Blue Sky&quot; in Japanese).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jsexnetwork_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsexnetwork.com/interviews/Sora_Aoi/|title=Sora Aoi Interview|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=www.jsexnetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aoi made her debut as a nude model in November 2001.

Aoi made two adult movies, ''Summer Break'' and ''Twinkle Twinkle'' which were supposedly aired on a subscription porn TV service, although details have not been confirmed yet.{{fact|date=May 2007}} She then signed with the [[Kuki Inc.]] group, one of Japan's largest producers of pornography at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avn.com/index.cfm?objectID=ED9EE0D6-1372-4B41-C47D18660792FF49&amp;slid=312746|title=Cross-Cultural Porn Digressions With Kuki Group's Tadasu Isogawa|date=January 1, 2004|accessdate=2008-01-10|last=Ochs|first=Stephen|publisher=[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the Samantha and [[Alice Japan]] companies.

===Documentary-influenced AVs===
Critics have often pointed out the documentary format employed in many Japanese adult videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/round-up_005.shtml|title=''Every Japanese Woman Makes Her Own Curry'' (review)|accessdate=2007-05-01|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com Midnight Eye]|quote=Matsue has said that his twin interests in movies are documentary and hardcore Adult Video. The similarities between the two genres - the recording of real, non-simulated action with the rawness of the production a testament to its vérité nature - have been picked up on by critics numerous times before.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aoi's second AV, her first for the MAX- A company's Samantha label, follows this format, pursuing the common theme of the actress' sexual initiation taking place on tape. By witnessing the actress' sexual awakening as it is occurring, the on-screen sexual activity is given added meaning to the video audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|title=A Star is Porn|accessdate=2007-05-01|last=Fornander|first=Kjell|year=1992|month=July|publisher=[http://www.tokyo.to/ Tokyo Journal]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060516235928/http://www2.gol.com/users/coynerhm/pornborn.html|archivedate=2006-05-16|quote=The first appearance for an AV girl is as a so-called &quot;new face.&quot; At this stage, says [Yusei] Maeda [AV manager], inexperience and innocence are her most important attributes. Viewers are invited to follow, from appearance to appearance, her sexual initiation, dawning self-awareness and gradual acceptance of her inner, dark depths.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This video, ''The Blue Sky: Sora Aoi'', makes use of the sexual awakening theme by purportedly showing Aoi using a sex toy for the first time in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2268|title=''The Blue Sky: Sora Aoi''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Facial'', released in August 2002, employed hand-held camera techniques to get a &quot;realistic and wild&quot; effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2278|title=''facial　 Sora Aoi''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story has Aoi having sexual encounters in a hotel hot spring. xcity.jp's reviewer commented at the time that Aoi was &quot;getting wilder and wilder in each video.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Willis|first=Brief|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/review/MAX_A/021225/XS2278.html|title=''facial　 Sora Aoi'' (AV review)|date=[[December 25]], [[2002]]|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Aoi's videos in the documentary format is the August 2003 entry in the ''Bubbly Heaven'' series. This video series has popular AV actresses learning [[soapland]] techniques from professionals, and then demonstrating their new skills for the video audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV268|title=''Bubbly Heaven: Sora Aoi''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictional AVs===
Though the mock-documentary format is popular in Japanese adult videos, purely fictional films in various genres also remain popular. ''50/50'' (December 2002) tells the story of a woman who works at a restaurant and a cabaret club in order to earn rent money for the apartment in which she and her boyfriend live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=DV204|title=''50/50''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gave Aoi a chance to wear a French maid costume, and to engage in sex with three different actors. xcity.jp reviewer &quot;Bug&quot; comments that the film is given a &quot;sweet&quot; quality by Aoi's frequent kissing of the actors during these scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOLA-GRAPH review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Bug|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/review/ALICE/030122/KA2101.html|title=''50 /50'' (AV review)|date=January 22, 2003|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sola-Graph'', released in January 2003, was Aoi's fourth appearance for the Samantha label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2283|title=''SOLA-GRAPH''|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video has Aoi engaging in sex with several prominent AV actors. Vegetables and fruit are involved in some of the encounters.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOLA-GRAPH review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Bug|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/review/MAX_A/030219/XS2283.html|title=''SOLA-GRAPH'' (AV review)|date=February 19, 2003|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aoi's last partner in the video is [[Taka Kato]], a legend in the Japanese AV world, whose ability to make women ejaculate through his manual dexterity has earned him the nickname, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryann|last=Connell|title=Japan's biggest male porno star finds his career going flaccid|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2007/05/20070528p2g00m0dm007000c.html|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=May 28, 2007|accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically for Kato, female ejaculation is featured in the final scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;SOLA-GRAPH review&quot;/&gt;

In February 2003's ''Wet and Tender'', Aoi plays the role of a prostitute pursued by both her boyfriend and a stalker until she is rescued by one of her regular customers, whom she then rewards with free sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2109|title=''Wet and Tender''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fukutome|first=Daisuke|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/review/ALICE/030312/KA2109.html|title=''Wet and Tender'' (AV review)|date=March 12, 2003|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The April 2003 release, ''Sexy Fruit'', had Aoi as an aspiring celebrity who gives sexual favors for singing and acting lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2115|title=''Sexy Fruit''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Little Sister's Secret'' of May 2003 made use of a story in the incest genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sisters_Secret&quot;/&gt; The sex scenes include ''[[paizuri]]'' with her boyfriend, face-sitting for her school teacher, and a sexual encounter with her brother-in-law. Aoi acted out a variety of emotions as demanded by her role in this drama, which the Kuki Group calls her best video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fukutome|first=Daisuke|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/review/ALICE/030702/KA2122.html|title=''Sister's Secret'' (AV review)|date=June 11, 2003|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sexy Butt'' of the following month had Aoi in love with a TV stuntman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2122|title=''Sexy Butt''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She fantasizes being manually satisfied by this actor, and has sexual encounters with a [[screenwriter]], and a man who owes a large debt. Despite the video's title, Aoi's posterior region was not given much emphasis in this video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yusaku|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/review/ALICE/030702/KA2122.html|title=''Sexy Butt'' (AV review)|date=July 2, 2003|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other genres===
In contrast to these urban-drama stories, some of Aoi's videos are in a more adventurous porno-science-fiction genre. Her October 2002 release for [[Alice Japan]], ''Cosmic Girl'', was an &quot;erotic comedy&quot; in which she played a super-heroine battling, and having sex with, aliens from the Vibe-star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=KA2094|title=''Cosmic Girl''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video included costume-play, with ''[[yukata]]'', and singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bug|url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/review/ALICE/021120/KA2094.html|title=''cosmic girl'' (AV review)|date=November 20, 2002|accessdate=2007-07-19|publisher=[http://xxx.xcity.jp/ xxx.xcity.jp]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her July 2003 video, ''Splash'', has Aoi living in the near future, at which time humanity is enslaved by the &quot;Ocean Species&quot;. Inter-species sexual encounters follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vinfo.xcity.jp/english/info.html?ID=XS2298|title=''Splash''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=[http://avidol.xcity.jp/english/index.html AV Idol Directory]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularity and mainstream recognition===
For her work in adult videos during her first year, Aoi won the &quot;Best Breasts Award&quot; at the [[Japanese Adult Video Awards#2003 X City Grand Prix Awards|AV Grand Prix]] awards ceremony of 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;grandprix2003&quot;/&gt; The same year, Aoi starred in the theatrically released ''[[pink film]]'' ''High School Teacher'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]). In this film she played two roles, the title character, and a girl who had committed suicide the year before the high school teacher arrived.&lt;ref name=&quot;grandprix_High_School_Teacher&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xxx.xcity.jp/city_org/grandprix2003/aoi/movie.html|title=''High School Teacher''|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=xxx.xcity.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her role in another ''pink film'', {{nihongo|''[[Tsumugi]]''|制服美少女　先生あたしを抱いて|Seifuku bishōjo: Sensei atashi wo daite}}, Aoi was given a Best Actress Award at the 2004 [[Pink Grand Prix]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/best10/2004.htm|title={{nihongo|Best Ten of 2004|２００４年度ベストテン}}|accessdate=January 21, 2009|publisher=[http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~p-g/menu.htm P*G Website]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was ranked the fourth best ''pink film'' release of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walkerplus-17th&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Toda|first=Miho|url=http://www.walkerplus.com/movie/report/report3435.html|title={{nihongo|&quot;Pink Prize&quot;: What Should Be Called the Academy Awards of the Pink Film World: Sora Aoi, Yumika Hayashi Among Those Present, Close Coverage of this Yearly Festival|ピンク映画界のアカデミー賞というべき“ピンク大賞”蒼井そら、林由美香らが来場する、年に一度の祭典に密着！|Pinku eigakai no akademii shou to iubeki &quot;Pinku taishou&quot; Aoi Sora, Hayashi Yumikaraga raijousuru, toshi ni ichido no saiten ni mitchaku}}|date=2005-05-06|accessdate=January 21, 2009|publisher=[http://www.walkerplus.com/movie/ www.walkerplus.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While continuing to perform in hardcore AVs, Aoi appeared in the first video release of the Shuffle company's new label Believe. Entitled ''The Naked Body'', this June 2003 release was an &quot;image video,&quot; which has nude modeling but no sex. ''Naked / Sora Aoi #2'' was Aoi's second &quot;image video&quot; for this company. This February 2004 release had Aoi modeling in [[Guam]]. By this time Aoi had become one of the most popular AV idols in Japan. Her name was the second-most popular [[Internet]] search on a female celebrity in Japan for 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beauty&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japan-zone.com/news/archives/2006_12.shtml|title=Beauty and the Beast|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=www.japan-zone.com}}; [http://web.archive.org/web/20070323001503/http://www.japan-zone.com/news/archives/2006_12.shtml archive]&lt;/ref&gt; and she was the most-searched AV idol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avstars.jsexnetwork.com/AV_Listing/english/_S/Sora_Aoi/|title=Sora Aoi (Aoi Sola)|accessdate=2007-05-01|publisher=avstars.jsexnetwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aoi's popularity enabled her to enter mainstream entertainment, including television and radio,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beauty&quot;/&gt; and singing on some [[punk rock]] albums.{{fact|date=May 2007}} Her popularity even extended to [[South Korea]], where the Korean hip-hop group, [[Epik High]] used one of her nude pictures to promote their concerts during their underground days. They were caught by the police, and publicly apologized to her years after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOSgrH2WTuo] 3'20&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Aoi continued to work for [[Alice Japan]] and Max-A's Samantha label until November 2004, when she moved to the newly formed studio, [[S1 No. 1 Style]], part of the large [[Hokuto Corporation]]. Her first video for S1, ''Sell Debut'', directed by [[Hideto Aki]], was released November 11, 2004. She has remained at S1, but has appeared in only six or fewer original videos per year since the beginning of 2006. One of her S1 videos, ''Hyper Risky Mosaic - Special Bath House Tsubaki'' (ハイパーギリギリモザイク 特殊浴場 TSUBAKI 貸切入浴料1億円), with 11 other S1 actresses won the First Place Award at the 2007 [[AV Open]] contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmm.co.jp/mono/dvd/avopen/avopen02_result.html|title=2nd AV Open Results|publisher=[http://www.dmm.co.jp/ www.dmm.co.jp]|accessdate=2008-10-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current life===
By 2006, Aoi was appearing regularly on television, including often appearing on variety shows and acting in several dramas&lt;ref name=&quot;Beauty&quot;/&gt; including the popular 2007 [[J-dorama]] detective show ''Galileo'' (ガリレオ)&lt;ref name=&quot;galileo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdorama.com/drama.1207.htm|title=Galileo [ガリレオ]|accessdate=2009-01-23|publisher=[http://www.jdorama.com/ www.jdorama.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. and the 2006 midnight-drama ''Shimokita GLORY DAYS'' (下北GLORY DAYS) along with fellow S1 actresses [[Yuma Asami]] and [[Honoka]] where she plays the character &quot;Nozomi Ichimonji&quot; in the [[manga]] based series about a [[Rōnin (student)|ronin]] student moving to Tokyo and sharing a house with several beautiful women.&lt;ref name=&quot;shimokita&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdorama.com/drama.1150.htm|title=Shimokita GLORY DAYS [下北GLORY DAYS]|accessdate=2008-01-23|publisher=[http://www.jdorama.com/ www.jdorama.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

She also had a part (non-nude) in a mainstream [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]]-[[teen]] [[movie]], ''[[Hormones (2008 film)|Hormones]]'' (Pid Term Yai, Hua Jai Waa Wun), released in March 2008. She plays a Japanese tourist who brings one character to the brink of infidelity to his girlfriend. Director [[Songyos Sugmakanan]] was criticized for using an AV star in a movie aimed at teens and Aoi was originally not included in promotional materials for the film. Sugmakanan defended his choice of Aoi as &quot;the average Thai man's dream&quot; and described Aoi as &quot;terrific&quot; and &quot;very professional&quot;. ''Hormones'' won the Jury's Special Prize at the fourth Asian Marine Film Festival in Japan which journalist Wise Kwai ascribed to Aoi's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thaifilmjournal.blogspot.com/2008/09/with-help-from-sora-aoi-hormones-wins.html|title=With help from Sora Aoi, Hormones wins jury prize at Japan's Asian Marine Film Festival |publisher=[http://thaifilmjournal.blogspot.com/ thaifilmjournal.blogspot.com]|accessdate=2009-01-13|date=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aoi made her debut in another Asian entertainment market when she appeared in a Korean TV drama ''Korean Classroom'' in May 2009. The four part series follows three Japanese girls traveling to Korea and co-stars fellow AV Idols Mihiro and [[Tina Yuzuki|Rio (Tina Yuzuki)]]. Aoi was subsequently scheduled to appear on several Korean variety shows while in Korea to promote the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/index.php/full_story/aoi_sora_and_mihiro_promote_korean_classroom/|title=Aoi Sora and Mihiro promote Korean Classroom|publisher=[http://www.allkpop.com/ AllKPop]|accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a December, 2006 issue of ''Friday'' magazine, Aoi was having a love affair with renowned ''[[owarai]]'' (comedic) artist [[Jiro Hachimitsu]]. Aoi and Hachimitsu were reportedly living together at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beauty&quot;/&gt; Their relationship ended in January 2009 as reported in their blogs according to Tokyograph News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-4299|title=Sora Aoi breaks up with comedian|publisher=[http://www.tokyograph.com/ Tokyograph News]|accessdate=2009-01-23|date=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Maria Ozawa'''|小澤マリア|Ozawa Maria}}, who used the name {{nihongo|'''Miyabi'''|みやび}} early in her career, is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[adult video]] (AV) actress known in Japan as an [[AV idol]]. 

==Life and career==
Ozawa was born in [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]] on January 8, 1986. Her mother is [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and her father is [[French-Canadian]]&lt;ref name=&quot;actionjav&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actionjav.com/model.cfm?actress_filename=maria_ozawa|title=''Maria Ozawa''|accessdate=2007-07-23|publisher=[http://www.actionjav.com/ www.actionjav.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since she attended an international school from Primary School to High School, she claims that her English reading and writing ability is better than her Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweatpig&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204222553/http://www.sweatpig.com/maria-ozawa-debut-interview/|archivedate=2008-02-04|url=http://www.sweatpig.com/maria-ozawa-debut-interview/|title=''Welcome to Maria Ozawa's Room'' Video Idol Interview|accessdate=2008-01-23|publisher=[http://www.sweatpig.com/ Sweat Pig: Japanese Adult Video News]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at school, she played hockey every day, and often went to [[karaoke]] after class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweatpig&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;18 questions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sweat Pig|title=18 Interesting Facts about Maria Ozawa (小澤マリア)|publisher=[http://www.sweatpig.com/ Sweat Pig: Japanese Adult Video News]|date=[[July 27]], [[2007]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080205083527/http://www.sweatpig.com/maria-ozawa-facts/|archivedate=2008-02-05|url= http://www.sweatpig.com/maria-ozawa-facts/|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozawa had her first sexual experience at the age of 13,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweatpig&quot;/&gt; and learned the &quot;48 sexual positions&quot; through a book that she bought herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweatpig&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, while still in high school, Ozawa appeared in a short (30 second) Japanese TV commercial for DARS Chocolate with the two members of the Japanese pop group [[KinKi Kids]]. The commercial has her sharing chocolate with one of the duo while secretly holding hands with the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/maria-ozawa-with-kinki-kids-in-dars-chocolate-ad-2002/|title=Maria Ozawa with Kinki Kids in DARS chocolate ad 2002|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|month=December|year=2007|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AV debut and S1===
She first encountered AVs ([[adult videos]]) by watching several tapes that belonged to a friend's brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweatpig&quot;/&gt; Unlike most AV actresses, Ozawa was not scouted. Instead, she was introduced to the AV industry through a friend that was working in AVs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweatpig&quot;/&gt; Ozawa was interested in the industry, and researched companies until she found B-open, a model agent which she liked. She applied for an interview with the company and was accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;18 questions&quot;/&gt; She started modeling as Miyabi for the pornographic site Shirouto-Teien.com in [[June 2005]], which resulted in several sets of photographs and a short hardcore [[Gonzo pornography|gonzo]] video released in CD-R and DVD-R formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirouto-teien.com/shopping/cd/main/contents/073_miyabi/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061123093743/http://www.shirouto-teien.com/shopping/cd/main/contents/073_miyabi/index.html|title={{nihongo2|みやび}} (Miyabi profile)|accessdate=2008-03-30|archivedate=2006-11-23|publisher=[http://www.shirouto-teien.com/ shirouto-teien.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was then signed by [[S1 No. 1 Style]], an AV studio that produces light hardcore pornography, premiering for them as Maria Ozawa on October 7, 2005 with the video ''New Face – Number One Style'' (新人xギリモザ ナンバーワンスタイル) directed by [[Hideto Aki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/years/years_2005.htm|title=2005|accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher=[http://homepage3.nifty.com/kurokami/index.html AV 研究所 (AV Research Laboratory)]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozawa remembers that she was so nervous during the filming of her first AV that she could not look the male actor in the face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweatpig&quot;/&gt; At S1, Ozawa subsequently appeared in one original video per month until February 2007. She was involved in several S1 compilation videos including the company’s entry in the 2006 [[AV Open]], a competition between Japanese porn studios for the best selling video. The S1 video ''Hyper – Barely There Mosaic'' (ハイパーギリギリモザイク), featuring Maria Ozawa along with other AV idols [[Sora Aoi]], [[Yua Aida]], [[Yuma Asami]], and [[Honoka]] (plus a short preview for [[Rin Aoki]]), won first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/japans-av-open-contest-2008/|title=Japan’s AV Open contest 2008|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|month=June|year=2008|language=English}} The original source http://www.av-open.com/ranking/index.html is closed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===DAS and other studios===
Maria Ozawa and S1 parted ways in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s1s1s1.com/actress/-/detail/=/id=15187/|title={{nihongo2|小澤マリア}} (S1 profile and filmography)|accessdate=2008-03-30|publisher=[http://s1s1s1.com/ s1s1s1.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Rin Suzuka, Reina Matsushima and [[Rin Aoki]], she moved from the safe, but popular S1 to a new startup company, Dasdas (DAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dasdas.jp/actress/-/detail/=/id=15187|title={{nihongo2|小澤マリア}} (Dasdas profile and filmography)|accessdate=2008-03-30|publisher=[http://www.dasdas.jp/ www.dasdas.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 2007, Dasdas released the first videos of the company, one of which (''Beautiful Eurasian News Anchor Maria Ozawa Desiring Nakadashi Rape'') featured Maria Ozawa. Dasdas videos contain scenes of [[rape pornography|rape]], [[creampie (sexual act)|creampie]], [[urolagnia]], [[enema]] and [[BDSM|physical torture]], themes not featured in the light hardcore style of her S1 videos. Her first &quot;[[Ethnicity of performers in pornography#Interracial pornography|interracial]]&quot; title ''Multiple Black Rape'' (黒人輪姦) was released from Dasdas in [[May 2008]].

By the end of 2007, she signed (not exclusively) with [[Attackers]] (アタッカーズ), an established AV studio that specializes in thematic rape pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.attackers.net/actress/-/detail/=/id=15187/|title={{nihongo2|小澤マリア}} (Attackers profile and filmography)|accessdate=2008-03-30|publisher=[http://www.attackers.net/ www.attackers.net]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008 she changed studios once again, going to the small start-up studio Ran-maru&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweatpig.com/author/admin/|title=Sweatpig: Ranmaru July Releases|accessdate=2008-06-22|publisher=[http://www.sweatpig.com/ www.sweatpig.com/]|language=English}}{{dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ran-maru.com/actress/ozawa_maria/bottom.html|title={{nihongo2|女優紹介: 小澤マリア (OZAWA MARIA)}} (Ran Maru actress profile and filmography)|accessdate=2008-06-22|publisher=[http://www.ran-maru.com/ www.ran-maru.com]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; which released her first video with them on July 19, 2008. Ran-maru, along with Ozawa's previous studios, S1, Dasdas and [[Attackers]], are all part of Japan's largest group of AV companies, the [[Hokuto Corporation]].

The latter part of 2008 has seen Ozawa in a variety of videos from different producers including her first exclusively [[lesbian pornography|lesbian]] (''Rezu'' - レズ) video (''W Cast Premium Lesbian'') for LADYxLADY, a division of the Japanese porn conglomerate [[Soft On Demand]] (SOD). In a more drastic career move, Ozawa decided to appear in her first &quot;uncensored&quot; movies which do not have the mosaic pixelation which is used to obscure the genitals in all standard Japanese porn videos. Four uncensored 45-minute videos of Ozawa and a single male actor were released online at XVN in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://monthly.xvn.jp/ja/x1/maria_ozawa.html|title=XVN：X-1 小澤マリア 初無修正の超S級AV女優が毎月登場！(XVN: X-1 AV Idol Maria Ozawa First Uncensored Videos)|accessdate=2008-10-04|publisher=[http://monthly.xvn.jp/ monthly.xvn.jp]|language=Japanese}} (The XVN website was closed on December 15, 2008. See http://www.xvn.com/index_en.html)&lt;/ref&gt; The  material from the first two videos was edited for a 90 minute DVD (''Tora-Tora Platinum Vol.49 Maria Ozawa'') released September 26, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.xvn.jp/ja/detail/d20066|title=Tora-Tora Platinum Vol.49 小澤マリア|accessdate=2008-10-04|publisher=[http://dvd.xvn.jp/ dvd.xvn.jp]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second two videos were combined as ''Tora-Tora Platinum Vol. 52 Maria Ozawa'' (December 31, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aventertainments.com/product_lists.aspx?product_id=26889&amp;languageID=1&amp;dept_id=0|title=Tora Tora Platinum Vol.52 : Maria Ozawa|accessdate=2009-01-12|publisher=[http://www.aventertainments.com/ www.aventertainments.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2009 [[AV GrandPrix]] three studios (DAS, [[Moodyz]], and M's Video Group) all selected videos starring Ozawa as their entries in the contest. The DAS compilation ''The Queen of DAS'' won the Best Violence Video Award and the M's Video Group entry ''Oral Venus'' took one of the Special Awards in the Featured Actress Video category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-gp.com/news/avgp_result/bottom.html|title=AVGP 2009 Result announcement|publisher=[http://www.av-gp.com/ www.av-gp.com]|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Ozawa returned to DAS to film ''Shemale Orgy Gangbang Rape'' (集団ニューハーフ輪姦乱交レイプ小澤マリア) with three transsexual actresses and in March 2009 made her debut in the Japanese porn genre of [[tentacle rape]] with ''Monster Swallowing Ecstasy Maria Ozawa'' (触獣丸呑みアクメ 小澤マリア) for [[Soft On Demand|SOD]].

===Other activities===
Besides adult videos, she has appeared in [[V-Cinema]] films, a [[photobook]] and several glamour (&quot;[[gravure idol|gravure]]&quot;) videos. In 2007, she played the character Anita (ｱﾆｰﾀ) on the popular Japanese TV drama [[Tokumei Kakarichō Tadano Hitoshi]] (特命係長・只野仁) on [[TV Asahi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/tadanohitoshi/i/04cast/018.html |title=Cast ｱﾆｰﾀ/小澤ﾏﾘｱ (Anita / Maria Ozawa)|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp www.tv-asahi.co.jp|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ozawa was on a 2007 episode of the Japanese variety show ''Megami no hatena'' (&quot;The Goddess of What Is That&quot;) on [[Nippon Television|Nihon TV]] as part of a series with AV actresses telling why they went into AV work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262995/|title=IMDB - &quot;Megami no hatena&quot; (2007)|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ www.imdb.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20070401cs.html|title=Comedy interview variety show|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://search.japantimes.co.jp The Japan Times Online]|month=April|year=2007|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also appeared on Japanese [[MTV Japan|MTV]] with the [[hip hop]] artist [[SEAMO]], who is also a fan,&lt;ref name=&quot;actionjav&quot;/&gt; and in the 2007 [[music video]] ''Summer Time in the D.S.C.'' with the [[Yokohama]] [[Japanese hip hop|hip hop]] group ''DS455''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/maria-ozawa-%e5%b0%8f%e6%be%a4-%e3%83%9e%e3%83%aa%e3%82%a2-in-japanese-ds455-hip-hip-video/|title=Maria Ozawa 小澤 マリア in Japanese DS455 hip hip video|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|month=April|year=2007|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozawa could be seen in 2007 performing twice at the [[Shinjuku]] striptease bar &quot;Shinjuku New Art&quot;. She took dance lessons to prepare but was still very nervous. She danced in a variety of outfits including appearing as a belly-dancer, a [[geisha]] and a cowgirl. Three videos were released of her performance and a behind-the-scenes interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/maria-ozawa-dances-at-japanese-strip-club/|title=Maria Ozawa dances at Japanese strip club|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|month=June|year=2008|language=English}} Has links to sample videos on AmebaVision&lt;/ref&gt;

She followed up on her Shinjuku experience by starring in a cabaret show in [[Macao]]. The show, called &quot;Tokyo Nights&quot;, ran at the  Rockza  night club in the Grand Lisboa Hotel from August 16 to September 6, 2008 and featured Ozawa and several other Japanese performers. The shows received mixed reviews. Promotional materials show her with a (temporary) tattoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/maria-ozawa-does-stint-as-a-macau-showgirl/|title=Maria Ozawa does stint as a Macau Showgirl|accessdate=2009-01-29|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|date=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ozawa acted in her first mainstream movie, ''Invitation Only'', billed as &quot;Taiwan's First-Ever Slasher Horror&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;See official site {{cite web |url=http://www.invitation-movie.com/|title=Invitation Only|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://www.invitation-movie.com www.invitation-movie.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is produced by Three Dots Entertainment in [[Taipei]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] and co-stars Julianne Chu. Ozawa plays a supermodel and has dialog in English and Japanese. Her professionalism impressed her co-workers and her role was expanded to include further scenes. The film was released in Taiwan in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229821/|title=IMDB - Invitation Only (2008)|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://www.imdb.com/ www.imdb.com]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/maria-ozawa-stars-in-taiwan-slasher-film-invitation-only/|title=Maria Ozawa stars in Taiwan slasher film Invitation Only|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|month=April|year=2008|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jasongray.blogspot.com/2008/03/invitation-only-japanese-adult-star.html|title=Invitation Only: Japanese Adult Star Maria Ozawa Grows Up|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://jasongray.blogspot.com Weblog of Jason Gray - Tokyo]|month=March|year=2008|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozawa, who is very popular in Taiwan, also did a photoshoot for the Taiwan version of [[FHM]] magazine in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/maria-ozawa-fhm-taiwan-video-photoshoot/|title=Maria Ozawa FHM Taiwan video photoshoot|accessdate=2009-06-05|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|date=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Her hobbies include cooking and watching AVs on her flatscreen television set.&lt;ref name=&quot;18 questions&quot;/&gt; She also enjoys playing video games, and owns a pink [[Nintendo DS Lite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameops.net/2007/04/maria-ozawa-plays-nintendo-ds.html|last=Jepoy|title=Maria Ozawa Plays Nintendo DS|publisher=[http://www.gameops.net/ GameOPS]|date=April 29, [[2007]]||accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a pink [[PlayStation 2]] console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameops.net/2007/06/maria-ozawa-owns-pink-playstation-2.html|last=Jepoy|title=Maria Ozawa Owns a Pink PlayStation 2|publisher=[http://www.gameops.net/ GameOPS]|date=June 19, 2007|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozawa has been fairly open about her private life granting several interviews and keeping a very detailed text and picture blog of her life and activities dating back to October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.dmm.co.jp/actress/ozawa_maria/| title={{nihongo2|小澤マリア 公式ブログ}} (Maria Ozawa Official Blog)|accessdate=2008-09-12|publisher=[http://blog.dmm.co.jp/ blog.dmm.co.jp/]|language=Japanese with occasional English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2007 interview, Ozawa reported that her interest in the AV industry remains high, and her video cabinet contains nothing but AVs. She makes a good living from the industry, living in a ''mansion'' (a high-class apartment) with a [[US$]]1,682-per-month rent, and earning a minimum of $8,000 per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;18 questions&quot;/&gt; However, while she says that she would quit the industry only if she is forced to do something else, she would try to prevent a friend from beginning work in the AV industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;18 questions&quot;/&gt; Ozawa's family and friends are against her chosen profession in spite of her apparent pride in her work. When she brought several of her videos home to show her parents, they refused to watch them and told her to get out.&lt;ref name=&quot;18 questions&quot;/&gt;

In mid-2008, it was reported in the Japanese tabloid newspapers ''[[Bungeishunjū|Shūkan Bunshun]]'' and ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' that Ozawa was dating [[J-pop]] star [[Koki Tanaka]] from the group KAT-TUN. According to the reports, Ozawa neither confirmed or denied the rumours, saying only &quot;If I’m dating someone I will stay devoted to him! I have a rule against sex friends. It’s not a good thing, plus having one boyfriend is enough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japansugoi.com/wordpress/maria-ozawa-dating-koki-tanaka/|title=Maria Ozawa dating Koki Tanaka?|accessdate=2009-03-26|publisher=[http://japansugoi.com/ JapanSugoi]|date=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is best known for playing the title role in director [[Mitsuru Meike]]'s ''[[The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai]]'' (2003).
==Life and career==
Emi Kuroda started her AV career in 2000 under the name Misuzu Akimoto. Often playing high school girl roles, she starred in such films as ''Virtual Sexpot'' and several volumes of ''Paradise of Japan'' (released in 2002 and 2003) which were made for the American market and so were &quot;uncensored&quot; unlike the usual Japanese porn videos which use a mosaic pixelation to obscure the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafreakcity.com/search_products.aspx?searchBy=starring&amp;Dept_ID=0&amp;section=0&amp;keyword=Misuzu+Akimoto&amp;languageID=1|title=Misuzu Akimoto |publisher=[http://www.mediafreakcity.com/ MFC]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 she changed her stage name to Emi Kuroda and by 2003 had appeared in more than 200 films.&lt;ref name=&quot;docstoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4291973/catfights-samples|title=About the Crew|publisher=[http://www.docstoc.com/ www.docstoc.com]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no previous theatrical acting experience, Kuroda was chosen to star in director [[Mitsuru Meike]]'s 2003 ''pink film'', ''[[The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema|page= 318|year=2008|publisher=FAB Press|location=Guildford|isbn=978-1-903254-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film gained a cult following and became a surprise international hit, playing at 20 film festivals and having a theatrical release in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jasper |last=Sharp |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20081204r1.html|title=Pink thrills: Japanese sex movies go global|accessdate=2009-06-21|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the film's tour of international film festivals, Kuroda was invited to speak at the PIA Film Festival in July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= 2005-07-15|url= http://www.cinematopics.com/cinema/c_report/index3.php?number=1465|title= ＰＦＦでコメディピンク、女池 充監督『花井さちこの華麗な生涯』が上映！|accessdate=2009-06-22|publisher=[http://www.cinematopics.com/ Cinema Topics Online]|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Gray| coauthors=Jasper Sharp|date= 2005-09-21|url= http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/round-up_017.shtml|title=The 27th Pia Film Festival and the Cineastes Organization Osaka EX|accessdate=2009-06-22|publisher=[http://www.midnighteye.com/ www.midnighteye.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Kuroda was arrested for [[public indecency]] as a patron in a sexual fantasy bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;docstoc&quot;/&gt; ''Sachiko Hanai'' screenwriter Nakano Takao introduced Kuroda to cat-fights, and she joined his cat-fight club &quot;Galshocker&quot; under the name &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;. She left her screen and video work to start up a career as a martial arts fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03182007/entertainment/movies/shes_gritty_in_pink_movies_v_a__musetto.htm|title=SHE'S GRITTY IN PINK|publisher=[http://www.nypost.com/ New York Post]|accessdate=2009-06-22|date=March 18, 2007|last=Musetto|first=V.

  Code notes (here so that people /read/ it)
  1. Parameter #2 is always nonempty when called from {{Citation/core}}.
  2. It's up to {{Citation/core}} to stop italicized &quot;'foo' &amp; 'bar'&quot; from becoming
     &quot;'''foo' &amp; 'bar'''&quot;. Citation/core does this by having a &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;!-- BE CAREFUL WITH COPY PASTING
HTMLTidy moves our whitespace around. We use &amp;#xfeff; (unicode zero width no break space/BOM) to force a space char at the end or beginning of a span to stay where it is, and this character gets lost in copypasting. This is a deprecated unicode character for these purposes, but it is the only method that works consistently around all browsers (opposed to #x2060 and #x200b).

{{maincat|Articles with specifically-marked weasel-worded phrases}}
This tag has been created in order to provide for a sleeker alternative for the bloating '''weasel''' tag. It is an alternative for {{t1|who?}} for statements like &quot;In some countries ...&quot; or &quot;In some scientific publications ...&quot; and the like.

This tag will categorise tagged articles into [[:Category:Articles with specifically-marked weasel-worded phrases]]. This template is especially efficient since you know what is needed even without clicking on the link.

This template creates a frame like those surrounding images. This template can be used to put two or more images into a frame together, or as a wrapper for more complicated templates like {{tl|superimpose}}. Sample code for using this template is presented below.
&lt;pre width=100%&gt;
{{Imageframe|width=|content=|caption=|link=|align=|pos=}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Parameters ==
;Required
*'''width''': the width of the image within the frame, in pixels (though do not add &quot;px&quot; to the width: ie, use width=175 and not width=175px)
*'''content''': content of the main section (generally images)

;Optional
*'''caption''': content of the caption section
*'''link''': link for the &quot;Enlarge&quot; link in the caption (in the future, may also be used as the link for the image field inside the frame, though it would probably require an additional ''height'' parameter)
*'''linkoverride''': allows anything to be used instead of the 'info' link
*'''align''': Valid values: right ''(default)'', left, center.
*'''pos''': Valid values: top, bottom ''(default)''
==Example==
By filling out the parameters as follows, the result will be as shown below the code.
&lt;pre width=100%&gt;
{{Imageframe|width=200|content=[[Image:Example.png|100px]][[Image:Example.png|100px]]|caption=Example usage|link=Hello world|align=center}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Imageframe|width=200|content=[[Image:Example.png|100px]][[Image:Example.png|100px]]|caption=Example usage|link=Hello world|align=center}}

&lt;pre width=100%&gt;
{{Imageframe|width=200|content=[[Image:Example.png|100px]][[Image:Example.png|100px]]|caption=Example usage|link=Hello world|align=center|pos=top}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{Imageframe|width=200|content=[[Image:Example.png|100px]][[Image:Example.png|100px]]|caption=Example usage|link=Hello world|align=center|pos=top}}

==Usage==
'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|2006|10}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' will provide: {{playmate|2006|10}}
where the word &quot;Playmate&quot; is replaced with the model's name.

This is for use in the external links section of Playmate's articles.

Notes:
* The year of their centerfold should be the first value and the month should be the second. Single digit months need not have a leading zero. Thus January would be 1, not 01.
* If the article's name has a disambiguator in it such as Christine Smith (adult model) then a third value should be used which would be her name. i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{playmate|2005|12|Christine Smith}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would yield {{playmate|2005|12|Christine Smith}}
