1. the APP loader does not correctly determine the start address
   so put the "int main(int argc, char **argv)" routine
   at the start of the program.

   Do this by putting the object at the beginning of the list of
   "OBJECTS +=" in the makefile.

   Alternatively create a separate stub file to be the first
   object module that calls main.  The code could simply be:

   int system_startup_routine(int argc, char **argv) {
       return main(int argc, char **argv);
   }
