Grifo
=====

This is a small kernel that exists as a separate program.
Its purpose is to simplify the application development process.

All low-level code will be in here and the application will be a
separate file.  All communications between the application and Grifo
will be via a system call interface (implemented using software interrupt).

directories:

src           Grifo sources and internal headers
lds           application.lds linker script
scripts       programs and scripts to generate other files during make
Mk            auxiliary makefiles
lib           libgruifo.a for application to link to
include       grifo.h for the application programs to #include
simulator     an emulator in QT to run applications on the host PC
stubs         generated syscall .s files
build         Grifo internal objects an libraries
examples      example applications and test programs
applications  programs that will be installed by default
