The Makefile is modified to make `enlzo' and `delzo' by default.

enlzo: compress the specified file and output to stdout.

delzo: decompress the specified file and output to stdout.

delzo is not really necessary but could be used to verification.
enlzo must be used to decompress the fontfile.gen generated by
`host-tools/glyphs/mk_fontfile/', since we're using the compressed
form of that file now.
