FILES
	is this file, dude!
README
	is the generic README for this package
README.eforth
	is the READ.ME from original eForth
README.linux
	is about this port
ChangeLog
	is a list of changes made in that port of eForth
Glossary
	the EFORTH.GLO glossary from original eForth package,
	with ^P converted in ^I as suggested.
	It ends in an odd way and looks like it was cut,
	but so did the original glossary found at above-mentionned address.
	If you know of a more complete file, please do tell...
TODO
	a list of suggestions for people who'd want to hack
	this port of eForth: pick one and implement it ;)
Makefile
	is so you can type "make" and have an eforth binary
eforth.S
	is the real thing, the source for eForth on Linux/i386
eforth.4th
	is the EFORTH.SRC from original eForth,
	that describes in FORTH the model followed by the eForth implentation
	(that was adapted and hand-compiled into the original EFORTH.ASM).
test.4th
	is a stupid script that I use to test whether eforth works.
