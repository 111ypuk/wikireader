* Any taker to port eforth 2.51? Contact Bill Muench <BiMu@aol.com>...

* We now have argc/argv/environ, so we can do everything in FORTH.
 However, one task would still be to adapt this eForth so as to mix with C
 (including dlopen(3) and such things).

* define sensible startup behavior,
 including parsing options, executing default configuration file,
 executing command file.

* define lots of words to do I/O, etc. i.e. make it a useful FORTH system ?

* Allow the user to save an image of system memory. Here are the difficulties:
 - the code to thread the dictionary should be run only once; it could be
  dropped and overwritten after the first time it is run. Or maybe someone
  could find a way to do it statically.
 - the machine state (useful register values; size of data areas) should be
  saved.
 - the various data areas should be compacted.
 - something should be done about open file descriptors, mmap(),
  and other such state. But what?
 - some garbage collecting could be done at that moment ?
 - some user-defined objects (such as files) should have user-defined ways
  to be saved and restored: buffers should be flushed, ways to reestablish
  connections and reinitialize access of remote resources should be remembered
  etc; memory mappings (including shared libraries) should be remembered, etc.
  A lot of work, which goes far beyond a port of eForth...
