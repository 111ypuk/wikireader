*) up-level gcc compiler
   EPSON does not want to do it, they say they prefer stability over new features.
   Sending patches upstream would require copyright transfer to FSF, would need to contact Seiko/EPSON.
   S1C33 is it's own core (available in 4- to 32-bit variants), so it's quite a few patches...

*) enable C99 in compiler, use C99 types more consistantly

*) C++ support
