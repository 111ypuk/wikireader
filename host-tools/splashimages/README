INSTALLATION:

Copy the image in question into the mbr folder and name it "splash.png". 
Run "make mbr" to have the image merged into the mbr binary. Reflash the
device and enjoy. :-)

If you want to create your own image make sure to have a monochrome image
where the image width is dividable by 8 and does not exeed 160 pixels.
