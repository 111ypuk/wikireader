Hacks to webkit to get the things we want.... to happen


The patches will patch the Gtk+ port of WebKit and the GtkLauncher
executable to create a directory with glyph information and write
one file with the positions of each glyph.
The glyph data is pnm....


= Run ./Programs/GtkLauncher on any url  =
After load directories with the pattern fonts/Font_Name_Size/GlyphIndex/
will be created. They contain font information and a bitmap of the glyph.

You will also find a render_text.blib. Containing the position of
each to be displayed glyph and the to be used font.

= Conver pnm to png =
Use this snippet to convert. This is needed as cairo only has a
png loader builtin...

for i in fonts/*/*/*.pnm; do pnmtopng $i > `dirname $i`/`basename $i pnm`png; done

= Render render_text.blib with the fonts =
Use the small cairo script render_text.py to convert the render_text.blib
into a rendered image.
